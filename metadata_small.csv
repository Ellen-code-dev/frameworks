Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify Inflammatory Biomarkers of a Response to Escitalopram in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder,"Objective: The aim of our study was to identify immune- and inflammation-related factors with clinical utility to predict the clinical efficacy of treatment for depression. Study Design: This was a follow-up study. Participants who met the entry criteria were administered with escitalopram (5–10 mg/day) as an initial treatment. Self-evaluation and observer valuations were arranged at the end of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, with blood samples collected at baseline and during weeks 2 and 12. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then carried out by incorporating three cytokines selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. Internal validation was estimated using the bootstrap method with 1,000 repetitions. Results: A total of 85 patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including 62 responders and 23 non-responders, were analyzed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lipocalin-2 were selected by the LASSO regression model. The area under the curve (AUC) from the logistic model was 0.811 and was confirmed as 0.7887 following bootstrapping validation. Conclusions: We established and validated a good prediction model to facilitate the individualized prediction of escitalopram treatment for MDD and created a personalized approach to treatment for patients with depression.",2021-05-20,Front Psychiatry,"Zhou, Jingjing; Zhou, Jia; Sun, Zuoli; Feng, Lei; Zhu, Xuequan; Yang, Jian; Wang, Gang"

Single domain shark VNAR antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"Single domain shark VNAR antibodies can offer a viable alternative to conventional Ig-based monoclonal antibodies in treating COVID-19 disease during the current pandemic. Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant ACE2 receptor in vitro. In addition, 3 antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition and formatting flexibility should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.",2021-06-08,bioRxiv,"Gauhar, Aziz; Privezentzev, Cyril V; Demydchuk, Mykhaylo; Gerlza, Tanja; Rieger, Julia; Kungl, Andreas J; Walsh, Frank S; Lynn Rutkowski, J; Stocki, Pawel"

Point-of-care ultrasound during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multidisciplinary approach between intensivists and echocardiographers,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) led to a large influx of critically ill patients and altered echocardiography laboratory workflow. We developed a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) first approach to patients requiring echocardiography and describe our workflow and findings. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all POCUS studies performed on critically ill patients with COVID-19. Sonography was performed by intensivists, uploaded and archived, and rapidly reviewed by echocardiographers. We evaluated each study based on the number of views obtained. Additionally, we provide a description of the workflow during the COVID-19 surge at a tertiary care hospital in New York City. RESULTS: Fifty patients had POCUS studies performed by intensivists and reviewed by echocardiographers obviating the need for sonographer-performed studies. Of the 48 cardiac POCUS studies, 17% of patients had 4 of 4 standard views available while 53% had 3 of 4 standard views. The parasternal long-axis view was obtained on 81%, subxiphoid view on 79%, apical 4-chamber view on 71%, and parasternal short-axis view on 63% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our POCUS workflow allowed intensivists to perform cardiac sonography for rapid bedside diagnosis of pathology with immediate interpretation performed by echocardiographers. At least 3 views were obtained in the majority of cases.",2021,Echocardiography,"Yuriditsky, Eugene; Saric, Muhamed; Horowitz, James M"
"Joint Predictive Value of cTnI and NT-proBNP on Mortality in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Research in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains to be the biggest public threat all over the world. Because of the rapid deterioration in some patients, markers that could predict poor clinical outcomes are urgently required. This study was to evaluate the predictive values of cardiac injury parameters, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, on mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: COVID-19 patients in Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 8–28, 2020, were enrolled in this study. We followed up the patients for 30 days after admission. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were included in the study. Multivariate Cox regression showed that 1) patients with elevated cTnI levels had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 7.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56–21.00) than patients with normal cTnI levels; 2) patients with elevated NT-proBNP levels had a higher risk of death (HR 27.88, 95% CI 3.55–218.78) than patients with normal NT-proBNP levels; 3) patients with both elevated cTnI and NT-proBNP levels had a significantly higher risk of death (HR 53.87, 95% CI 6.31–459.91, P < 0.001) compared to patients without elevated cTnI or NT-proBNP levels; 4) the progressions of cTnI and NT-proBNP levels were also correlated with death (HR 12.70, 95% CI 3.94–40.88, P < 0.001 and HR 51.09, 95% CI 5.82–448.26, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients, cTnI and NT-proBNP levels could be monitored to identify patients at a high risk of death in their later course of disease.",2021-09-28,J Transl Int Med,"Weng, Haoyu; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Long; Jin, Han; Liu, Shengcong; Fan, Fangfang; Liu, Zhihao; Zheng, Xizi; Yang, Hongyu; Li, Yuxi; Yi, Tieci; Li, Haichao; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianping"
"Glass hybrid (glass ionomer) versus composite for non-carious cervical lesions: Survival, restoration quality and costs in randomized controlled trial after 3 years.","OBJECTIVE This study compared survival, restoration quality and costs of glass hybrid (GH; EQUIA Forte Fil/EQUIA Forte Coat) and resin composite restorations (RC; OptiBond FL/Filtek Supreme XTE) of sclerotic non-carious cervical lesions. METHODS This is a cluster-randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02631161). 88 patients (50-70 years) with 175 sNCCLs were randomized to receive GH or RC. Restorations were placed without mechanical cavity preparation and followed for a mean 36 (min/max: 31/55) months (variable follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown). Restoration quality was re-evaluated at 1-, 18- and 36-months using FDI-criteria. Survival was assessed using multi-level Cox-regression analysis. Costs were estimated from a payer's perspective in Germany. Initial costs were determined based on micro-costing using time recordings and hourly costs, and follow-up costs based on statutory insurance fee-item-catalogues. RESULTS 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17 GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5 GH were partially lost (p = 0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (p < 0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 €) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 €; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 €), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 €) than RC (51.6; 26.17 €) (p < 0.001/GLM). CONCLUSIONS While survival was not significantly different, GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Within this trial, survival was not significantly different between GH and RC to restore sclerotic NCCLs. As GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC, using RC was only cost-effective for payers willing to invest high additional expenses per minimal survival gains.",2021-05-09,Journal of dentistry,"Schwendicke, Falk; Müller, Anne; Seifert, Tilmann; Jeggle-Engbert, Linda-Maria; Paris, Sebastian; Göstemeyer, Gerd"
Screening of immune-related differentially expressed genes from primary lymphatic organs of broilers fed with probiotic bacillus cereus PAS38 based on suppression subtractive hybridization,"To explore the molecular mechanism of the effect of Bacillus cereus PAS38 on the immunity of broilers, sixty 7-day-old broilers were divided into two groups with three replicates. The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×106 CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level. A total of 42 immune-related differentially expressed genes were screened, including 22 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes. When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might up-regulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers.",2020,PLoS One,"Li, Jiajun; Li, Wanqiang; Wang, Zhenhua; Khalique, Abdul; Wang, Junrui; Yang, Miao; Ni, Xueqin; Zeng, Dong; Zhang, Dongmei; Zeng, Yan; Luo, Qihui; Jing, Bo; Pan, Kangcheng"
Monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reveals high sensitivity of the nucleocapsid protein in acute-phase sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients.,"Accurate and timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection is a critical step in preventing another global outbreak. In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The specificity of the assay was 100%. Furthermore, of 16 sera collected from four patients during the SARS recurrence in Guangzhou, 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate, 96 to 100%, between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutralization test-positive SARS patients and 298 serologically confirmed patients. The N protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10, and N protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms. In conclusion, an antigen capture ELISA reveals a high N protein detection rate in acute-phase sera of patients with SARS, which makes it useful for early diagnosis of SARS.",2005,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,"Di, Biao; Hao, Wei; Gao, Yang; Wang, Ming; Wang, Ya-di; Qiu, Li-wen; Wen, Kun; Zhou, Duan-hua; Wu, Xin-wei; Lu, En-jie; Liao, Zhi-yong; Mei, Ya-bo; Zheng, Bo-jian; Che, Xiao-yan"

A novel biomarker-based prognostic score in acute ischemic stroke: The CoRisk score.,"OBJECTIVES To derive and externally validate a copeptin-based parsimonious score to predict unfavorable outcome 3 months after an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of patients with AIS enrolled prospectively at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The validation cohort was prospectively enrolled after the derivation cohort at the University Hospital of Bern and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, as well as Frankfurt a.M., Germany. The score components were copeptin levels, age, NIH Stroke Scale, and recanalization therapy (CoRisk score). Copeptin levels were measured in plasma drawn within 24 hours of AIS and before any recanalization therapy. The primary outcome of disability and death at 3 months was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6. RESULTS Overall, 1,102 patients were included in the analysis; the derivation cohort contributed 319 patients, and the validation cohort contributed 783. An unfavorable outcome was observed among 436 patients (40%). For the 3-month prediction of disability and death, the CoRisk score was well calibrated in the validation cohort, for which the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.819 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.787-0.849). The calibrated CoRisk score correctly classified 75% of patients (95% CI 72-78). The net reclassification index between the calibrated CoRisk scores with and without copeptin was 46% (95% CI 32-60). CONCLUSIONS The biomarker-based CoRisk score for the prediction of disability and death was externally validated, was well calibrated, and performed better than the same score without copeptin.

High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping Platform (HT3P) as a Novel Tool for Estimating Agronomic Traits From the Lab to the Field,"Food scarcity, population growth, and global climate change have propelled crop yield growth driven by high-throughput phenotyping into the era of big data. However, access to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier that phenomics urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant phenotyping platform (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems, can take full advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor, quantify, and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments, and it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial, customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments, as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives on future development trends of HT3Ps. This review aims to provide ideas, thoughts, and insights for the optimal selection, exploitation, and utilization of HT3Ps, and thereby pave the way to break through current phenotyping bottlenecks in botany.",2021-01-13,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,"Li, Daoliang; Quan, Chaoqun; Song, Zhaoyang; Li, Xiang; Yu, Guanghui; Li, Cheng; Muhammad, Akhter"
The impact of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance and the role of real interest rate,"The objective of this study is to explore the impact of commodity price volatility on the governments’ fiscal balance. Using a dynamic panel data model for 108 countries from 1993 to 2018, this study finds that governments’ fiscal balance deteriorates with commodity price volatility, especially for commodity-exporting economies. A one standard deviation increase in commodity price volatility leads to a reduction of approximately 0.04 units in the fiscal balance as a percentage of gross domestic product. Further, we examine the role of real interest rates in influencing the relationship between commodity price volatility and fiscal balance. The empirical results suggest that the negative impact of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance can be mitigated with a lower real interest rate. This implies under the sticky price assumption, an accommodative monetary policy could be effective in moderating the negative effect of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance.",2022-01-11,Empir Econ,"Majumder, Monoj Kumar; Raghavan, Mala; Vespignani, Joaquin"
SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics. SETTING: Laboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study. INTERVENTIONS: Ten different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points. RESULTS: At one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.",2021-02-08,,"Edwards, T.; Kay, G.

Plasma ACE2 predicts outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigate associations between plasma ACE2 and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This analysis used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes. The samples were run on the Olink® Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. High admission plasma ACE2 in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased maximal illness severity within 28 days with OR = 1.8, 95%-CI: 1.4–2.3 (P < 0.0001). Plasma ACE2 was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension compared with patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). Circulating ACE2 was also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that measuring plasma ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 could be a link between COVID-19 illness severity and its established risk factors hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease.",2021-06-04,PLoS One,"Kragstrup, Tue W.; Singh, Helene Søgaard; Grundberg, Ida; Nielsen, Ane Langkilde-Lauesen; Rivellese, Felice; Mehta, Arnav; Goldberg, Marcia B.; Filbin, Michael R.; Qvist, Per; Bibby, Bo Martin"
Pediatric urology amidst SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Building the future with current knowledge,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has ripped around the globe, stolen family members and forced healthcare systems to operate under an unprecedented strain. As of December 2020, 74.7 million people have contracted COVID-19 worldwide and although vaccine distribution has commenced, a recent rise in cases suggest that the pandemic is far from over. METHODS: This piece explores how COVID-19 has explicitly impacted the field of pediatric urology and its patients with a focus on vulnerable subpopulations. RESULTS: Various medical and surgical associations have published guidelines in reaction to the initial onset of the pandemic in early 2020. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As the number of patients with COVID-19 increases, long-term recovery and future preparedness are imperative and should be cognizant of patient subpopulations that have been subject to disproportionate morbidity and mortality burden. Development of a dedicated response team would aid in achieving preparedness by drafting and implementing plans for resource allocation during scarcity, including logistic and ethical considerations of vaccine distribution.

Versatile SARS-CoV-2 Reverse-Genetics Systems for the Study of Antiviral Resistance and Replication,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.",2022-01-18,Viruses,"Fahnøe, Ulrik; Pham, Long V.; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Costa, Rui; Rivera-Rangel, Lizandro René; Galli, Andrea; Feng, Shan; Mikkelsen, Lotte S.; Gottwein, Judith M.; Scheel, Troels K.

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the pediatric population in the setting of lung protective ventilation. DESIGN A 1-yr, prospective, multicenter, observational study in 12 geographical areas of Spain (serving a population of 3.77 million ≤ 15 yrs of age) covered by 21 pediatric intensive care units. SUBJECTS All consecutive pediatric patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and meeting American-European Consensus Criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Data on ventilatory management, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and organ dysfunction were collected. A total of 146 mechanically ventilated patients fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome definition, representing a incidence of 3.9/100,000 population ≤ 15 yrs of age/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the time of meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria, mean PaO2/FIO2 was 99 mm Hg ± 41 mm Hg, mean tidal volume was 7.6 mL/kg ± 1.8 mL/kg predicted body weight, mean plateau pressure was 27 cm H2O ± 6 cm H2O, and mean positive end-expiratory pressure was 8.9 cm ± 2.9 cm H2O. Overall pediatric intensive care unit and hospital mortality were 26% (95% confidence interval 19.6-33.7) and 27.4% (95% confidence interval 20.8-35.1), respectively. At 24 hrs, after the assessment of oxygenation under standard ventilatory settings, 118 (80.8%) patients continued to meet acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria (PaO2/FIO2 104 mm Hg ± 36 mm Hg; pediatric intensive care units mortality 30.5%), whereas 28 patients (19.2%) had a PaO2/FIO2 >200 mm Hg (pediatric intensive care units mortality 7.1%) (p = .014). CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study to estimate prospectively the pediatric population-based acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and the first incidence study performed during the routine application of lung protective ventilation in children. Our findings support a lower acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and mortality than those reported for adults. PaO2/FIO2 ratios at acute respiratory distress syndrome onset and at 24 hrs after onset were helpful in defining groups at greater risk of dying (clinical trials registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT 01142544).",2012,Critical care medicine,"López-Fernández, Yolanda; Azagra, Amelia Martínez-de; de la Oliva, Pedro; Modesto, Vicent; Sánchez, Juan I; Parrilla, Julio; Arroyo, María José; Reyes, Susana Beatriz; Pons-Ódena, Martí; López-Herce, Jesús; Fernández, Rosa Lidia; Kacmarek, Robert M; Villar, Jesús"
Pediatric Percutaneous Osteoid Osteoma Ablation: Cone-Beam CT with Fluoroscopic Overlay Versus Conventional CT Guidance.,"PURPOSE To compare technical success, clinical success, complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time for osteoid osteoma thermal (radiofrequency or microwave) ablation using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with two-axis fluoroscopic navigational overlay versus conventional computed tomography (CT) guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify all osteoid osteoma ablations performed over a 5.5-year period at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Twenty-five ablations (15 radiofrequency and 10 microwave) in 23 patients undergoing fluoroscopic CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma ablation were compared to 35 ablations (35 radiofrequency) in 32 patients undergoing ablation via conventional CT guidance. Dose area product and dose length product were recorded for CBCT and conventional CT, respectively, and converted to effective doses. Technical success, clinical success (cessation of pain and medication use 1 month after ablation), complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time were compared. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Twenty-two of 25 (88.0%) CBCT and 31 of 35 (88.6%) conventional CT-guided ablations achieved immediate clinical success. There were two minor complications in each group and no major complications. Mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for CBCT compared to CT guidance (0.12 vs. 0.39 mSv, p = 0.02). Mean total room utilization time for CBCT was longer (133.5 vs. 97.5 min, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Fluoroscopic CBCT guidance for percutaneous osteoid osteoma ablation yields similar technical and clinical success, reduced radiation dose, and increased total room utilization time compared to conventional CT guidance.",2017,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,"Perry, Brandon C; Monroe, Eric J; McKay, Tyler; Kanal, Kalpana M; Shivaram, Giridhar"

Datenplattformökosysteme,"Platform ecosystems have become a source of sustained competitive advantages over pipeline models. A platform consists of a platform core (such as a smartphone operating system, a marketplace or a music streaming service) which is controlled by the platform owner who orchestrates the relationship between customers and providers (e.g. the distribution of goods, apps or music to end-users). Recently, the utilization and monetization of data has been significantly increasing. While some sources report the existence of data platforms as technical repositories to distribute data, the literature is sparse in discussing the role of data in platform ecosystems or outlining the existence of data platform ecosystems. By combining the technical concept of a data platform with the one of a platform ecosystem, a data platform ecosystem emerges. It comprises a platform ecosystem that facilitates the recombination and exchange of data around a stable core between a wide range of complements of data providers and prospective customers. To understand the characteristics of data platform ecosystems, we will elaborate on the concepts of data modularity, data quality, disposal and usage rights of data as well as ways to address the information paradox inherent to data. Based on these key properties, we illustrate the emergence of data platform ecosystems through two case examples and suggest avenues for future research.",2021-03-29,HMD,"Kramberg, Philipp; Heinzl, Armin"
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples from cats in the UK associated with human-to-cat transmission,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to find evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK cats. DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.",2021,Vet Rec,"Hosie, Margaret J; Epifano, Ilaria; Herder, Vanessa; Orton, Richard J; Stevenson, Andrew; Johnson, Natasha; MacDonald, Emma; Dunbar, Dawn; McDonald, Michael; Howie, Fiona; Tennant, Bryn; Herrity, Darcy; Da Silva Filipe, Ana; Streicker, Daniel G; Willett, Brian J; Murcia, Pablo R; Jarrett, Ruth F; Robertson, David L; Weir, William"

Epidemic processes with vaccination and immunity loss studied with the BLUES function method,"The Beyond-Linear-Use-of-Equation-Superposition (BLUES) function method is extended to coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations and applied to the epidemiological SIRS model with vaccination. Accurate analytic approximations are obtained for the time evolution of the susceptible and infected population fractions. The results are compared with those obtained with alternative methods, notably Adomian decomposition, variational iteration and homotopy perturbation. In contrast with these methods, the BLUES iteration converges rapidly, globally, and captures the exact asymptotic behavior for long times. The time of the infection peak is calculated using the BLUES approximants and the results are compared with numerical solutions, which indicate that the method is able to generate useful analytic expressions that coincide with the (numerically) exact ones already for a small number of iterations.",2021-06-30,,"Berx, Jonas; Indekeu, Joseph O"

Industry 4.0 technologies and their applications in fighting COVID-19 pandemic using deep learning techniques,"The disease known as COVID-19 has turned into a pandemic and spread all over the world. The fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0 includes digitization, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Industry 4.0 has the potential to fulfil customized requirements during the COVID-19 emergency crises. The development of a prediction framework can help health authorities to react appropriately and rapidly. Clinical imaging like X-rays and computed tomography (CT) can play a significant part in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients that will help with appropriate treatment. The X-ray images could help in developing an automated system for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. This study makes use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract significant features and discriminate X-ray images of infected patients from non-infected ones. Multiple image processing techniques are used to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the entire X-ray image. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes. This system allows COVID-19 patients to be processed by an automated screening system with minimal human contact.",2022-03-21,Comput Biol Med,"Ahmad, Muhammad; Sadiq, Saima; Eshmawi, Ala’ Abdulmajid; Alluhaidan, Ala Saleh; Umer, Muhammad; Ullah, Saleem; Nappi, Michele"
Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and early clinical outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies in Lithuania: a national prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Haematological malignancies and their treatments are likely to affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0–10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18–60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18–60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292–20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831–33 553]; p<0·0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629–16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0–7]; p<0·0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0–45]; p<0·0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0–1218]; p=0·0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1–2319]; p<0·0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335–19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451–16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120–16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

Association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular events in COVID-19,"Cardiovascular complications have been reported in patients with COVID-19. We sought to examine the association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. We examined 409 individuals enrolled in the COVID-19 Registry to Assess Frequency, Management, and Outcomes of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications (CORONA-VTE) who had ABO blood group data available. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found. Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE(ORA/non-A 2.18[1.11-4.29]), while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACE(ORO/non-O 0.50[0.26-0.97]). In conclusion, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID-19. These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients for cardiovascular complications.

Telerehabilitation of a Patient Post-buttockectomy and Internal Hemipelvectomy Secondary to Pelvic Round Cell Sarcoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Report,"Pelvic sarcomas are rare malignancies that can result in extensive surgeries involving bone and soft tissue resection, which can greatly improve with rehabilitation. However, due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rehabilitation of patients with pelvic sarcomas was affected. Limited information is also presented in the literature regarding the rehabilitation of patients with lower extremity surgeries undergoing telerehabilitation and during a pandemic. This study presents the rehabilitation process of a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with pelvic round cell sarcoma of the right gluteal area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient underwent wide excision, buttockectomy and internal hemipelvectomy, and we measured outcomes using the Tinetti assessment tool (TAT) and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). A decreased risk of falls and improved functional performance were recorded using the TAT and LEFS respectively. Telerehabilitation was noted to have a good satisfaction rate among the patient and health workers. Telerehabilitation may be an effective alternative to face-to-face therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Persistence of Bacteriophage Phi 6 on Porous and Nonporous Surfaces and the Potential for Its Use as an Ebola Virus or Coronavirus Surrogate,"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.",2020,,"Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura"
Make this tango viral: Touching toward the untouchable in tele- synaesthesia performance,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an uncanny rift between tact and touch as it expands the virtual towards its potential. Layer upon layer of new information has been repeatedly revising and reformulating our sense of touch. The uncondi-tional freedom of touch needs to be rendered accountable in this rift of time and space. The act of touching entails individual acknowledging the risk of reaching towards the unknown or the known. Tracing with a tactile sense of touch is to be tactful about how, where and what can such act of touching could reach, especially in the context of communicative technology. This article focuses on the possibil-ity of virtual sensibility by challenging ways to feel touched beyond the nostal-gic narratives that attempt to indict communicative technology with the loss of touch. To replenish and reinstate touch through tele-synaesthesia performance, I ask: how to elongate our somatosensensation and echo the embodied experience of touching through virtual connectivity? Tele-synaesthesia performance joints tele-matic and synaesthetic experience together to embody the incorporeality of touch through virtual connectivity. It embodies the injunction of physical contact and challenges what can and cannot be touched by suturing one sensuous modality to another. Inspired by Paul Sermon's artistic production of Telematic Quarantine (2020) and Pandemic Encounters (2020), that tele-presents the stories of self (isolation), I have created The Best Facial (2021): a series of one-to-one participatory tele-synaesthesia performances, where I became a virtual aesthetician and performed 'virtual facial care' on Zoom amid the second wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. In this article, I will discuss how tele-synaesthesia performance could trigger tactile experiences in the participants in reference to Michel Foucault's concept Heterotopia (1986) that allegorically address the incompatible physical places in the society. I discuss how to elicit an affective sensory response from non-tactile senses through virtual touch, as stated by Naomi Bennett's 'Telematic connections: sensing, feeling, being in space together' (2020). I refer to Legacy Russell's discussion on glitch (2020) to analyse the possible future of tele-synaesthesia performance and its potential for expanding virtual connectivity with an ethical touch of a non-performative refusal of the present.",2021,Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art,"Hao, A.

This retrospective study collected 169 patients from March 2020 to February 2021 at our hospital. Baseline data were collected from patients. The absolute values (Abs) and percentages (%) of immune cell subsets for lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+, B cells, NK cells, and NKT cells were measured using flow Cytometry. Among the included patients, 43 patients were in the nonsurvivor group and 126 patients were in the survivor group. The age of patients in the nonsurvivor survivor was higher than that of survivor group patients (P = .020). SOFA, APACHE II, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group (all P values < .05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that lymphocytes (%) and SOFA were independent risk factors affecting patients’ prognosis. Lymphocytes (%) have the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.812). The model area under the ROC curve for immune cell subsets was 0.800, with a sensitivity of 72.09%, and specificity of 79.27% (z = 7.796, P < .001). Analysis of patient prognosis by immune cell subsets diagnostic showed statistically significant differences in the grouping of cut-off values for all 5 indicators (all P < .05). The lymphocytes (%) and SOFA score are independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients.

Effects of foliar selenium application on growth and rhizospheric soil micro-ecological environment of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz,"Atractylodes macrocephala (A. macrocephala), a famous medicinal herb in China, is widely cultivated and consumed in China with various beneficial effects. Numerous studies have shown that selenium (Se) plays an important role in promoting plant growth, although Se has not been considered an essential element for higher plants. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of foliar Se application (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg m(−2) Se in sodium selenite, sprayed monthly from May to August) on the growth and rhizospheric soil micro-ecological environment of A. macrocephala, and explore the possible mechanisms underlying plant response to foliar Se application through a field experiment. The results were: The foliar application of 5.0 mg m(−2) Se significantly increased the survival rate of A. macrocephala compared to the control. The yield of A. macrocephala was increased when the Se level maintained belowed 10.0 mg m(−2) but decreased when Se level reached 20.0 mg m(−2). The Se content in the rhizome of A. macrocephala showed a significant positive correlation with the Se level, while the insect attack rate was significantly negatively correlated with the Se level. However, foliar Se application hardly affected the concentration of bioactive compound atractylenolide in the rhizome of A. macrocephala. Notably, the application of foliar Se changed the content of partial soil nutrients, microbial diversity and composition in the rhizosphere soil of A. macrocephala. Bacterial diversity was positively correlated with A. macrocephala growth whereas fungal diversity was negatively correlated, suggesting that microbial diversity in the rhizosphere soils is closely related to plant growth. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that available potassium, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus in rhizospheric soil might be critical factors for promoting the growth of A. macrocephala. Overall, the foliar application of Se at moderate concentration was beneficial for the growth of A. macrocephala, and 5.0-10.0 mg m(−2) Se level was the optimum. Our findings revealed novel insights into the response of A. macrocephala to foliar Se application from plant growth, rhizospheric soil nutrient and microbial community composition .",2020-10-22,S Afr J Bot,"Zhou, Wuxian; Duan, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yajuan; Wang, Hua; Huang, Donghai; Zhang, Meide"
Knowledge and attitudes of Ebola among the general public of Trinidad and Tobago during the 2014-15 West Africa outbreak,"Objective Health system resilience and resilience of a country include the capacity of health personnel, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises. This study investigates the knowledge and attitudes of the public concerning Ebola Virus Disease in Trinidad and Tobago. Design and Methods A cross sectional study whereby respondents (n = 920) were sampled from public places. Data were collected via interviewer administered questionnaires. Data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Results The response rate was 67.6 % (622/920). The main age category of responders was the 20 to 30 year age category (40.5%); responders were mostly female (58.0 %). Regarding knowledge, there were significant differences among occupational categories (F = 2.811, df1 = 6, df2 = 571, p-value = 0.011). Tukey’s HSD post hoc test revealed that the mean knowledge scores for professional and sales occupations differed significantly (p-value = 0.003). There was a significant association between being afraid to go for treatment and age (p-value = 0.001). Significant associations were also found between occupational grouping and education attainment with opinion about the preparedness of private medical facilities, likelihood to shun family members with Ebola, being afraid to go for treatment and preference for traditional medicine (p-value <0.05).

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a safe option for benign lung diseases requiring lobectomy.,"BACKGROUND Lobectomy for benign lung disease is renowned to be technically complex and to be subjected to an increased complication rate. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated. METHODS We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ 2 test and Student's t test; any p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pathology did not impact on outcomes after VATS lobectomy. This study suggests that VATS is as a safe option in selected patients with benign disease requiring lobectomy, despite a more complex technical context.",2017,Surgical endoscopy,"Mazzella, Antonio; Olland, Anne; Garelli, Elena; Renaud, Stephane; Reeb, Jeremie; Santelmo, Nicola; Falcoz, Pierre Emmanuel; Massard, Gilbert"
Critical Care Requirements Under Uncontrolled Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Objectives. To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications. Pandemic control strategies that rely exclusively on protecting the elderly are likely to overwhelm health care systems.",2021,Am J Public Health,"Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; Domingo-Relloso, Arce; Arribas, José R; Quintana-Díaz, Manuel; Hernán, Miguel A"
Establishment of feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures for the propagation and study of feline enteric coronaviruses,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most feared infectious cause of death in cats, induced by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79–1683 and WSU 79–1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79–1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79–1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.",2013-08-21,Vet Res,"Desmarets, Lowiese MB; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Olyslaegers, Dominique AJ; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Vermeulen, Ben L; Roukaerts, Inge DM; Nauwynck, Hans J"
Emergency management of the pre-hospital phase in COVID-19 patient: Literature review,The addition of COVID-19 cases took place quite quickly and has spread between countries. The high incidence is important to improve health services especially the pre-hospital phase services. In this phase good emergency management will reduce the number of disabilities to death by up to 50% by starting from activating calls prior to the incident location health workers who understand first aid and transportation using an ambulance and being observed until they arrive at the hospital. Knowing the Pre-Hospital Phase Emergency Management in COVID-19 Patient: Literature Review. The research method used is a literature review. In this method online searches for articles journals and books are carried out using accessible databases namely Google Scholar PubMed and Biomed Central. It is known from 10 Literature Articles journals and books in the emergency management of COVID-19 in the Pre-Hospital phase must be done as much as possible to minimize the number of deaths and transmission that occurs. Handling of emergency COVID-19 in the Pre-Hospital phase includes: Basic and Advanced Life Support (BLS) Oxygen Therapy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Patient Transport. It is important for medical personnel to pay attention to many things in providing emergency nursing care to COVID-19 patient. Pre-Hospital emergency measures for patient with COVID-19 can be carried out in various ways to improve the patient condition while at the Pre-Hospital besides that it can also prevent transmission to medical personnel and people around COVID-19 patient.,2021,Jurnal Riset Kesehatan,"Mohtar, M.

Comparison of optimal distribution route for personal protection equipment by saving matrix and tabu search methods using nearest neighbor approach at covid-19 referral hospitals in west java,"At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the disease was spread across the universe. This virus has level of blistering transmission because it can be transmitted through the air. To contain the outbreak, the people need to be self-isolated to minimize interaction with other people. In this case, the health workers are on the front line to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. It is because they must be dealing with the affected patients directly by taking care of them during their self-isolation period. The health workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid the virus transmission. In this turmoil, the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE is quite worrying. Therefore, the Indonesian government and every government around the world are arm in arm organize a worldwide aid in the form of PPE distribution through referral hospitals, with the objective of making the health workers safer. This research is aimed at conducting a simulation of distribution to obtain PPE route distribution in a more effective and efficient ways to get an optimal route. In this case, this research had been conducted by comparing two methods: Saving matrix and tabu search for Hazmat suit distribution. Apart from getting an optimal route, the cost and time could be pushed more effectively to clock the fastest time in distribution with the fewest cost of distribution. The simulation of distribution point used was Distribution Center of West Java as an origin point, specifically at the COVID-19 referral hospitals in West Java, which was listed on the PIKOBAR site as the beneficiary of the PPE and the data of health workers in West Java mentioned in Central Agency on Statistics or locally known as BPS as the determinant of the requested PPE numbers. The result of this research showed that Tabu Search method was more optimal compared to Saving Matrix method based on similar approach, Nearest Neighbor, in determining the route that resulted in four distribution routes. This study showed that Saving Matrix research method concluded a mileage of 2.404 km in 80 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.505.968, while Tabu Search concluded a mileage of 2.351 km in 78 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.437.492. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Effectors of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Type IV Secretion System Mediate Killing of Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Previously, we documented that Stenotrophomonas maltophilia encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that allows the organism to kill, in contact-dependent fashion, heterologous bacteria, including wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bioinformatic screens based largely on the presence of both a C-terminal consensus sequence and an adjacent gene encoding a cognate immunity protein identified 13 potential antibacterial effectors, most of which were highly conserved among sequenced strains of S. maltophilia. The immunity proteins of two of these proved especially capable of protecting P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli against attack from the Stenotrophomonas T4SS. In turn, S. maltophilia mutants lacking the putative effectors RS14245 and RS14255 were impaired for killing not only laboratory E. coli but clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including ones isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. That complemented mutants behaved as wild type did confirmed that RS14245 and RS14255 are required for the bactericidal activity of the S. maltophilia T4SS. Moreover, a mutant lacking both of these proteins was as impaired as a mutant lacking the T4SS apparatus, indicating that RS14245 and RS14255 account for (nearly) all of the bactericidal effects seen. Utilizing an interbacterial protein translocation assay, we determined that RS14245 and RS14255 are bona fide substrates of the T4SS, a result confirmed by examination of mutants lacking both the T4SS and the individual effectors. Delivery of the cloned 14245 protein (alone) into the periplasm resulted in the killing of target bacteria, indicating that this effector, a putative lipase, is both necessary and sufficient for bactericidal activity.",2021-06-29,mBio,"Nas, Megan Y.; Gabell, Jeffrey; Cianciotto, Nicholas P."

New clinical algorithm including fungal biomarkers to better diagnose probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in ICU,"BACKGROUND: The classification of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) issued by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) is used for immunocompromised patients. An alternative algorithm adapted to the intensive care unit (ICU) population has been proposed (AspICU), but this algorithm did not include microbial biomarkers such as the galactomannan antigen and the Aspergillus quantitative PCR. The objective of the present pilot study was to evaluate a new algorithm that includes fungal biomarkers (BM-AspICU) for the diagnosis of probable IPA in an ICU population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 35 patients with pathology-proven IPA according to European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSGERC)-2008 criteria were extracted from the French multicenter database of the Invasive Fungal Infections Surveillance Network (RESSIF). The patients were investigated according to the AspICU algorithm, and the BM-AspICU algorithm in analyzing the clinical, imaging, and biomarker data available in the records, without taking into account the pathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients had to be excluded because no imaging data were recorded in the database. Among the 27 proven IPAs with complete data, 16 would have been considered as putative IPA with the AspICU algorithm and 24 would have been considered as probable IPA using the new algorithm BM-AspICU. Seven out of the 8 patients with probable BM-AspICU IPA (and not classified with the AspICU algorithm) had no host factors and no Aspergillus-positive broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture. Three patients were non-classifiable with any of the two algorithms, because they did not have any microbial criteria during the course of the infection, and diagnosis of proven aspergillosis was done using autopsy samples. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of biomarkers could be effective to identify probable IPA in the ICU population. A prospective study is needed to validate the routine application of the BM-AspICU algorithm in the ICU population.",2021-03-08,Ann Intensive Care,"Hamam, Joffrey; Navellou, Jean-Christophe; Bellanger, Anne-Pauline; Bretagne, Stéphane; Winiszewski, Hadrien; Scherer, Emeline; Piton, Gael; Millon, Laurence"
Eukaryotic life without tQCUG: the role of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications in Dictyosteliumdiscoideum.,"In the Elongator-dependent modification pathway, chemical modifications are introduced at the wobble uridines at position 34 in transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which serve to optimize codon translation rates. Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals. The implications of this observation are discussed with respect to the evolutionary age of the components acting in the Elongator-dependent modification pathway.",2020-07-01,Nucleic acids research,"Schäck, Manfred A; Jablonski, Kim Philipp; Gräf, Stefan; Klassen, Roland; Schaffrath, Raffael; Kellner, Stefanie; Hammann, Christian"

We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases. Although number of-available full-genomes is growing daily, and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 datasets still present severe limitations. Studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating.

"Assessment of a Multifaceted Approach, Including Frequent PCR Testing, to Mitigation of COVID-19 Transmission at a Residential Historically Black University","IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 posed an unprecedented threat to residential colleges in the fall of 2020. While there were mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission, there were no established or tested protocols of COVID-19 testing or mitigation for school administrators to follow. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of a multifaceted COVID-19 mitigation strategy using social, behavioral, and educational interventions and a program of frequent testing with prevalence of disease spread. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted as a retrospective review of COVID-19 positivity from August 16, 2020, to April 30, 2021, at Delaware State University, a publicly funded historically Black university. Participants included all students, faculty, and staff members with a campus presence. Positivity rates after use of mitigation strategies and testing on campus were compared with those of the surrounding community. Data were analyzed from July through September 2021. EXPOSURES: Mitigation strategies included education and outreach about social distancing, masking, and handwashing, and a COVID-19 testing plan consisted of twice-weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using anterior nasal samples (fall and early spring semester) and then saliva-based samples (middle to late spring semester). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative tests, infections, daily quarantine, and isolation residence hall occupancy were measured, and comparisons were made with statewide COVID-19 positivity rates. RESULTS: The campus cohort included 2320 individuals (1575 resident students, 415 nonresident students, and 330 faculty or staff members). There were 1488 (64.1%) women and 832 (35.9%) men; mean (SD) age was 27.5 (12.9) years. During the fall semester, 36 500 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 0 of 372 tests to 16 of 869 tests (1.8%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.5% [0.5%]; 168 positive results and 36 312 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 589 of 25 120 tests (2.3%) to 5405 of 54 596 tests (9.9%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 4.8% [2.6%]). In the spring semester, 39 045 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 4 of 2028 tests (0.2%) to 36 of 900 tests (4.0%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.8% [0.9%]; 267 positive results and 38 767 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 1336 of 37 254 tests (3.6%) to 3630 of 42 458 tests (8.5%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 5.1% [1.3%]). Compared with statewide rates, campus positivity rates were mean (SD) 4.4 (2.6) percentage points lower during the fall semester (P < .001) and mean (SD) 5.6 (1.6) percentage points lower during the spring semester (P < .001). Total daily quarantine and isolation residence hall occupancy ranged from 0 to 43 students in the fall and 1 to 47 students during the spring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that the combination of campuswide mitigation policies and twice-weekly COVID-19 PCR screening was associated with a significant decrease in COVID-19 positivity at a residential historically Black university campus compared with the surrounding community. Given the socioeconomic demographics of many students at historically Black colleges and universities, keeping these resident campuses open is critical not only to ensure access to educational resources, but also to provide housing and food security.",2021-12-13,JAMA Netw Open,"Hockstein, Neil G.; Moultrie, LaKresha; Fisher, Michelle; Mason, R.

A review of the safety of favipiravir - a potential treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Background: Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19 We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19 Methods: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials gov All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU) Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28 2% vs 28 4% (P = n s ) in the comparison arms The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1 1% vs 1 2% (P = n s ) in the comparison arms For serious AEs the proportion was 0 4% in both arms (P = n s ) There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8 7% vs 11 5%;P = 0 003] Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5 8% vs 1 3%;P&lt;0 0001] Conclusions: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19",2020,J Virus Erad,"Pilkington, Victoria; Pepperrell, Toby; Hill, Andrew"
Impact of School Closures due to COVID-19 on Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Japan,"In March 2020, many schools were closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan, and it is predicted that many children, especially those with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), will be affected emotionally and behaviorally. Here, we examined the impact of school closures due to COVID-19 on school-aged children with NDDs using the Child Behavior Checklist. Totally, data on 121 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and/or intellectual disorder were analyzed and it was found that externalizing and aggressive behavior increased in all NDDs, regardless of the type of diagnosis. A clear prospect is important for children with NDDs children to lead a stable life, and more generous supports for children with NDDs and their families are needed.

Estimating the early impact of immunization against COVID-19 on deaths among elderly people in Brazil: analyses of secondary data on vaccine coverage and mortality.,"ABSTRACT Background Immunization against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years. Methods By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021. Findings As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9. Interpretation Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.",2021-04-30,,"Victora, C.

NK cell receptor and ligand composition influences the clearance of SARS-CoV-2,"To explore how the immune system controls clearance of SARS-CoV-2, we used a single-cell, mass cytometry-based proteomics platform to profile the immune systems of 21 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection without need for admission to an intensive care unit or for mechanical ventilation. We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells. Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021,J. clin. invest,"Hsieh, Wan-Chen; Lai, En-Yu; Liu, Yu-Ting; Wang, Yi-Fu; Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan; Cui, Lu; Lai, Yun-Ju; Huang, Hsiang-Chi; Huang, Jia-Hsin; Ni, Hung-Chih; Tsai, Dong-Yan; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liao, Chun-Che; Lu, Ya-Ting; Jiang, Laurence; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Wang, Jann-Tay; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Chen, Chung-Yu; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Chang, Yao-Ming; Wernig, Gerlinde; Li, Chia-Wei; Lin, Kuo-I; Lin, Yi-Ling; Tsai, Huai-Kuang; Huang, Yen-Tsung; Chen, Shih-Yu"

A COVID-19 contextual study of customers’ mistreatment and counterproductive work behavior at coffee cafés,"PurposeThe issue of customer mistreatment in food and retail sectors has come under the spotlight during the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the problem in the COVID-19 pandemic context and study its implications for employee counterproductive behavior in the workplace. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the relationship between customer mistreatment and employee counterproductive behavior by considering the mediating role of cognitive rumination and moderating role of servant leadership at coffee cafés that operated during the COVID-19 smart lockdown period.Design/methodology/approachStructured questionnaires were distributed to 479 frontline staff working at cafés and coffee shops located in two large cities of Pakistan. The questionnaire data were analyzed by using bootstrapped regression procedures to determine how the investigated variables influenced counterproductive work behavior during the pandemic.FindingsThe findings revealed a positive influence of customer mistreatment on counterproductive work behavior both directly as well as indirectly in the presence of employee rumination as a mediator. Furthermore, the presence of servant leadership at cafés and coffee shops was found to moderate the impact of customer mistreatment during the pandemic.Originality/valueThe study offers a novel insight into the relationships between mistreatment by customers, counterproductive work behavior, employee rumination and servant leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic context, hitherto unexplored.",2021,British Food Journal,"Ahmed, Ishfaq Islam Talat Ahmad Saima Kaleem Ahmad"

Characterization of IgG Antibody Response against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in the Cypriot Population,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has hit its second year and continues to damage lives and livelihoods across the globe. There continues to be a global effort to present serological data on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different individuals. As such, this study aimed to characterize the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Cypriot population for the first time since the pandemic started. Our results show that a majority of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed IgG antibodies against the virus, whether anti-NP, anti-S1RBD, or both, at least 20 days after their infection. Additionally, the percentage of people with at least one antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in the group of volunteers deemed SARS-CoV-2 negative via RT-PCR or who remain untested/undetermined (14.43%) is comparable to other reported percentages worldwide, ranging anywhere from 0.2% to 24%. We postulate that these percentages reflect the underreporting of true infections in the population, and also show the steady increase of herd immunity. Additionally, we showed a significantly marked decrease in anti-NP IgG antibodies in contrast to relatively stable levels of anti-S1RBD IgG antibodies in previously infected individuals across time.",2021-12-31,Microorganisms,"Krashias, George; Deeba, Elie; Constantinou, Astero; Hadjiagapiou, Maria; Koptides, Dana; Richter, Jan; Tryfonos, Christina; Bashiardes, Stavros; Lambrianides, Anastasia; Loizidou, Maria A.; Hadjisavvas, Andreas; Panayiotidis, Mihalis I.; Christodoulou, Christina"
Patient-Reported Questionnaires to Identify Adverse Drug Reactions: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND This systematic review aims to summarise available patient-reported questionnaires to detect adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that can be utilised by healthcare professionals in clinical practice and to summarise the psychometric properties (validity, reliability, and responsiveness) of the questionnaires. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Pubmed, Embase, and Emcare databases to screen for articles published between January 2000 and July 2020. Data items regarding validity, reliability, and responsiveness were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN (Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments) checklist. RESULTS A total of 1563 unique article titles were identified after removing duplicates. Following shortlisting of relevant articles, 19 patient-reported ADR questionnaires were identified. Questionnaires most commonly focused on mental health medications (42.1%, n = 8), followed by general questionnaires applicable to any medication (21.1%, n = 4). Many questionnaires did not report assessing the validity and reliability of the measurement tool. For example, only 11 questionnaires (58%) mentioned assessing content validity, in addition to criterion or construct testing. CONCLUSION This systematic review summarised the available patient-reported questionnaires that can be used in research and clinical practice to identify ADRs. Results of this systematic review highlight the need for more robust validity and reliability testing when developing patient-reported ADR questionnaires.",2021-11-12,International journal of environmental research and public health,"Lim, Renly; Ellett, Lisa Kalisch; Roughead, Elizabeth E; Cheah, Phaik Yeong; Masnoon, Nashwa"
The anti-inflammatory cytokine response characterized by elevated interleukin-10 is a stronger predictor of severe disease and poor outcomes than the pro-inflammatory cytokine response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"OBJECTIVES: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune state. While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with outcomes. METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was maximum COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and new positive bacterial cultures (all p&#8804;0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were associated with 42% (p=0.031) and 32% (p=0.013) increased odds, respectively, of severe COVID-19. When standardized to a one-unit standard deviations scale, an increase in the IL-10 was a stronger predictor of maximum 30-day severity and severe AKI than increases in IL-6 or IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of new positive bacterial cultures. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, elevated IL-10 was more strongly associated with outcomes than pro-inflammatory IL-6 or IL-8. The anti-inflammatory response in COVID-19 requires further investigation to enable more precise immunomodulatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2.",2021,Clin Chem Lab Med,"Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; Vikse, Jens; Berger, Brandon A; Pulvino, Christina; Hoehn, Jonathan; Rose, James; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L"
"Clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19-infected children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit: a single-center experience","BACKGROUND: During the second wave of COVID-19, there is an increasing incidence of reported cases in children compared to the early wave. Data on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 in children are evolving, and reports on the characteristics and outcomes of severe COVID-19 in children are still under evaluation. We aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes of children with COVID-19 infection admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). RESULTS: The study included 27 children with COVID-19 infection. Fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were predominant presenting symptoms in our patients. The median age of our patients was 9 months (2 m–12 years). Comorbidity was reported in 59.3%. The typical laboratory findings were leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive proteins levels, and elevated d-dimer levels. The most frequent radiological findings were ground-glass opacities in 100% of patients and bilateral findings in 96%, while cardiomegaly was found in 44% of patients. The multisystem inflammatory syndrome was reported in 33% of patients with GIT symptoms were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Myocarditis was reported in 22% of patients. The mortality rate in this cohort was 14.8%. On multivariate analysis, the only predictor of mortality was the development of MIS-C. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is more severe in children with comorbid conditions. Fever, respiratory and gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were predominant presenting symptoms. MIS-C is of increasing concern in children with high mortality rates.

Probiotics at War Against Viruses: What Is Missing From the Picture?,"Our world is now facing a multitude of novel infectious diseases. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, albeit with increasing difficulty as many of the more common causes of infection have now developed broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance. However, there is now an even greater challenge from both old and new viruses capable of causing respiratory, enteric, and urogenital infections. Reports of viruses resistant to frontline therapeutic drugs are steadily increasing and there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Although this all makes sense, it seems rather strange that relatively little attention has been given to the antiviral capabilities of probiotics. Over the years, beneficial strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been successfully used to treat gastrointestinal, oral, and vaginal infections, and some can also effect a reduction in serum cholesterol levels. Some probiotics prevent gastrointestinal dysbiosis and, by doing so, reduce the risk of developing secondary infections. Other probiotics exhibit anti-tumor and immunomodulating properties, and in some studies, antiviral activities have been reported for probiotic bacteria and/or their metabolites. Unfortunately, the mechanistic basis of the observed beneficial effects of probiotics in countering viral infections is sometimes unclear. Interestingly, in COVID-19 patients, a clear decrease has been observed in cell numbers of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp., both of which are common sources of intestinal probiotics. The present review, specifically motivated by the need to implement effective new counters to SARS-CoV-2, focusses attention on viruses capable of co-infecting humans and other animals and specifically explores the potential of probiotic bacteria and their metabolites to intervene with the process of virus infection. The goal is to help to provide a more informed background for the planning of future probiotic-based antiviral research.",2020-08-20,Front Microbiol,"Tiwari, Santosh Kumar; Dicks, Leon M.

Artificial Intelligence Model of Drive-Through Vaccination Simulation,"Planning for mass vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 is ongoing in many countries considering that vaccine will be available for the general public in the near future. Rapid mass vaccination while a pandemic is ongoing requires the use of traditional and new temporary vaccination clinics. Use of drive-through has been suggested as one of the possible effective temporary mass vaccinations among other methods. In this study, we present a machine learning model that has been developed based on a big dataset derived from 125K runs of a drive-through mass vaccination simulation tool. The results show that the model is able to reasonably well predict the key outputs of the simulation tool. Therefore, the model has been turned to an online application that can help mass vaccination planners to assess the outcomes of different types of drive-through mass vaccination facilities much faster.",2020-12-31,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Asgary, Ali; Valtchev, Svetozar Zarko; Chen, Michael; Najafabadi, Mahdi M.; Wu, Jianhong"

"Correlation between Post-COVID-19, Chemosensitive Function, Blood Group, and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life","Materials and Methods A cross-sectional information on demographics, symptomatic disease status, ABO blood group, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) was collected among 100 patients who were earlier tested positive for COVID-19 reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and were now reporting to the College of Dentistry for routine treatment after recovery. Objective evaluation of olfactory and gustatory disturbances was elicited using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test and gustatory function testing. Furthermore, OHRQoL was assessed using Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Results More than half of the patients (62%) had some form of olfactory dysfunction/alteration, and 42% had poor CCCRC scores. About 14% reported ageusia, while 68% reported some form of taste alterations, and 55% reported poor OHRQoL. A statistically significant difference was reported between different ABO blood groups and subjective loss of smell (p < 0.05). The subjective loss of taste, CCCRC score, and dysgeusia were found to be independent of OHIP-14 (p > 0.05), but the taste intensity score was dependent on OHIP 14 (p < 0.05). Moreover, a majority (70.8% and 70.0%) with poor OHIP-14 scores had taste intensity scores of 3 and 4, respectively, while those with moderate (68.4% and 48.6%) OHIP-14 had scored 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion Olfactory and gustatory disturbances were found to be a long-term feature in post-COVID-19 patients.

Protein provision and lower mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severely impacted the management of critically ill patients, including nutritional therapy. This study aimed to verify an association between mortality and the energy and protein provided to critically ill patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 and receiving enteral nutrition support. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19, with >7 days of stay in the ICU, on enteral nutrition were followed from the moment of hospitalization until discharge from the ICU or death. Data about age, gender, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS3), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), clinical endpoint outcome (discharge or death), and daily energy and protein provision were collected from electronic medical records. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meyer curves were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (66.2 ± 13.1 years; 53.8% women) were enrolled in the present study. The mean length of hospitalizations and SAPS3 score were 17.8 ± 9.8 days and 78.7 ± 14.7, respectively; all patients needed mechanical ventilation (mean of days was 16.42 ± 9.1). For most patients (73.1%) the endpoint was death. Twenty-five percent of patients had protein supply >0.8 g/IBW/day. Survival during COVID-19 hospitalization at ICU was significantly different among patients according to protein supply (p = 0.005). Hazard Ratios (HR) for protein supply showed that a protein intake >0.8 g/IBW/day was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR 0.322, p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a protein supply at least > 0.8 g/IBW/day could be related to reduced mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19.",2021-07-16,Clin Nutr ESPEN,"Silvah, Jose Henrique; de Lima, Cristiane Maria Martires; Nicoletti, Carolina Ferreira; Barbosa, Ana Carolina; Junqueira, Gizela Pedroso; da Cunha, Selma Freire de Carvalho; Marchini, Julio Sergio"
Preparation and Characterization of Microcapsules Containing Antioxidant Fish Protein Hydrolysates: a New Use of Bycatch in Brazil.,"In this study, we evaluated the effect of complexation and microencapsulation with pea protein on the antioxidant activity of protein hydrolysates from bycatch in Brazil. The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5 ± 1.7 μm to 183 ± 2.8 μm). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch. This study provides evidence for the potential use of bycatch from shrimp fisheries as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals.",2021-03-24,Marine biotechnology,"Camargo, Tavani Rocha; Khelissa, Simon; Chihib, Nour Eddine; Dumas, Emilie; Wang, Jian; Valenti, Wagner C; Gharsallaoui, Adem"
Protocol for a scoping review of post-trial extensions of randomised controlled trials using individually linked administrative and registry data.,"INTRODUCTION Well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the least biased estimates of intervention effects. However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming to perform and long-term follow-up of participants may be hampered by lost contacts and financial constraints. Advances in computing and population-based registries have created new possibilities for increasing the value of RCTs by post-trial extension using linkage to routinely collected administrative/registry data in order to determine long-term interventional effects. There have been recent important examples, including 20+ years follow-up studies of trials of pravastatin and mammography. Despite the potential value of post-trial extension, there has been no systematic study of this literature. This scoping review aims to characterise published post-trial extension studies, assess their value, and identify any potential challenges associated with this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will use the recommended methods for scoping reviews. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A draft search strategy is included in this protocol. Review of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible studies and data/information extraction will be conducted independently by pairs of investigators. Eligible studies will be RCTs that investigated healthcare interventions that were extended by individual linkage to administrative/registry/electronic medical records data after the completion of the planned follow-up period. Information concerning the original trial, characteristics of the extension study, any clinical, policy or ethical implications and methodological or practical challenges will be collected using standardised forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study uses secondary data, and does not include person-level data, ethics approval is not required. We aim to disseminate these findings through journals and conferences targeting triallists and researchers involved in health data linkage. We aim to produce guidance for investigators on the conduct of post-trial extensions using routinely collected data.",2017,BMJ open,"Fitzpatrick, Tiffany; Perrier, Laure; Tricco, Andrea C; Straus, Sharon E; Jüni, Peter; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Lix, Lisa M; Smith, Mark; Rosella, Laura C; Henry, David A"
Noninvasive ventilation for patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"Few studies have been performed on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to treat hypoxic acute respiratory failure in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The outcomes of these patients, for whom endotracheal intubation is not mandatory, depend on the degree of hypoxia, the presence of comorbidities and complications, and their illness severity. The use of NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation in severely hypoxemic patients with ARDS (ie, P(aO(2))/F(IO(2)) < 200) is not generally advisable and should be limited to hemodynamically stable patients who can be closely monitored in an intensive care unit by highly skilled staff. Early NIV application may be extremely helpful in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates, in whom intubation dramatically increases the risk of infection, pneumonia, and death. The use of NIV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other airborne diseases has generated debate, despite encouraging clinical results, mainly because of safety issues. Overall, the high rate of NIV failure suggests a cautious approach to NIV use in patients with ALI/ARDS, including early initiation, intensive monitoring, and prompt intubation if signs of NIV failure emerge.",2011,Respiratory care,"Nava, Stefano; Schreiber, Ania; Domenighetti, Guido"
Browning and quality management of pear fruit by salicylic acid treatment during low temperature storage,"BACKGROUND: ""Patharnakh"" pear, a dominant cultivar in the Punjab province of India, has a shorter storage life as it matures during the hot and humid weather. Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS: SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

Facets of Social Innovation in Higher Education,"Emphasis on social engagement and innovation for the higher education sector is a priority, despite the various challenges that have arisen as result of Covid-19, for third level providers. It is a conversation that continues to evolve of how the higher education providers can prepare students for global citizenship and societal innovation. There are specific concerns regarding best practice and the contribution of higher education to teaching, research and ultimately public policy. Universities are embedded in teaching and research whereby the onus is to engage collaboratively with outside organisations to develop competences and create products for greater use by society. This chapter aims to explore how the higher education institutions can contribute to transforming teaching and research so that the student, and ultimately each academic community member, experiences the full value of contributing to a successful society, reflecting on sustainable partnerships, engagement, whilst reflecting the whole idea of societal innovation. Its ambition is to define spheres of influence for enhancing social innovation in higher education. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,"Innovation, Technology and Knowledge Management","McDonnell-Naughton, M.; Păunescu, C."

Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty are unique and interactive risk factors for COVID-19 safety behaviors and worries.,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety sensitivity (AS) predict distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about how AS and IU jointly predict COVID-19 worries and behaviors. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and interactive effects of AS and IU as related to COVID-19 worries and behaviors in two samples of community adults recruited in April 2020 (N = 642; M age = 38.50 years, SD = 10.00) and May 2020 (N = 435; M age = 34.92 years, SD = 14.98). In sample 1, there was a significant AS by IU interaction predicting COVID-19-related catastrophizing worries, stockpiling, and cleaning behaviors such that the relationship of AS to COVID-19-related behaviors was stronger at high levels of IU. However, although AS predicted some COVID-19 related worries and behaviors, AS and IU did not interact in sample 2. Across samples, AS was directly related to financial and health worries, whereas IU was not a significant predictor after controlling for AS. These findings suggest AS consistently impacts COVID-19 worries and behaviors, particularly among individuals with high IU. Brief interventions targeting AS and IU may help people cope during the COVID-19 pandemic and reintegrate following the pandemic.",2021-10-26,Cognitive behaviour therapy,"Saulnier, Kevin G; Koscinski, Brandon; Volarov, Marija; Accorso, Catherine; Austin, Megan J; Suhr, Julie A; Allan, Darcey; Allan, Nicholas"
The Rise and Fall of Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine in COVID-19,"On March 11th, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the unprecedented outbreak of ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2) to be a pandemic. Thus far, COVID-19 has infected over 58,229,138 individuals and caused 1,382,106 deaths worldwide. This has led to the re-purposing of available drugs under ""off-label"" use-drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Both drugs have since been evaluated for their ability to treat COVID-19. Here, we summarize recent evidence regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

"COVID-19, Stigma, and the Ongoing Marginalization of Sex Workers and their Support Organizations","Primary or first-hand stigma, associated with sex work, sometimes disparagingly referred to as ""prostitution"" or ""whore"" stigma, was a fundamental cause of social inequities for sex workers before the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, courtesy stigma, or stigma by association linked with involvement with a stigmatized group, has long limited the ability of sex worker organizations to secure adequate funds to meet the needs of sex workers in their communities. In reaction to the pandemic, sex worker organizations quickly responded and in a variety of ways have been helping to ease the impact of the pandemic on sex workers in their communities. In November 2020, we interviewed 10 members of sex worker organizations from seven different communities across Canada about how they have been dealing with the immediate and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their communities. Three strategic actions stood out in the interviews: (1) challenging stigma to help sex workers access government emergency funding; (2) reorganizing and adapting services to provide outreach to sex workers in their communities; and (3) advocating for continuous organizational funding. The findings show that primary stigma and courtesy stigma have further marginalized sex worker organizations and their clients during the pandemic. We conclude with participants’ recommendations to address avoidable harms of COVID-19 among sex workers and to better support sex worker organizations in Canada.",2021-11-22,Arch Sex Behav,"Benoit, Cecilia; Unsworth, Róisín"
Case Report: Dengue and COVID-19 Coinfection in Thailand,"We report a 50-year-old Thai woman with recent travel to Denmark who presented with acute high-grade fever, vomiting, and myalgia for 1 day. Initial laboratory results revealed leukopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase, and elevated alanine transaminase. Chest radiograph showed no pulmonary infiltration. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab detected SARS-CoV-2, and RT-PCR of the blood detected dengue virus serotype 2. COVID-19 with dengue fever co-infection was diagnosed. Her symptoms were improved with supportive treatment. Integration of clinical manifestations, history of exposure, laboratory profiles, and dynamic of disease progression assisted the physicians in precise diagnosis. Co-circulating and nonspecific presentations of dengue infection and COVID-19 challenge the healthcare system in tropical countries.

Assessment of thyroid function of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Nigeria,"INTRODUCTION: the outbreak and rapid spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has evolved into an unprecedented global pandemic. The infection impairs several human organs and systems, however, it is not clear how it affects thyroid function. The study therefore aimed at measuring plasma levels of thyroid hormones and Hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients and apparently healthy uninfected controls to assess the possible effect of SAR-CoV-2 infection on thyroid function. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study carried out between May-August 2020, 90 consenting participants comprising 45 COVID-19 patients and 45 apparently healthy uninfected controls were recruited. Plasma FT3, FT4, TSH and Hs-CRP were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean plasma FT3 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). Euthyroidism was observed in all uninfected controls, whereas 35 (77.8%) COVID-19 patients were euthyroid. Sick euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 7 (15.6%) and 3 (6.7%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: though there was a preponderance of euthyroidism among COVID-19 patients, significantly higher mean plasma levels of TSH and FT3, sick euthyroid syndrome and subclinical hypothyroidism observed among some COVID-19 patients may be indicative of disease-related thyroid function changes. Hence, there is need to pay attention to thyroid function during and after treatment of COVID-19.",2021-09-02,Pan Afr Med J,"Okwor, Chika Juliet; Meka, Ijeoma Angela; Akinwande, Kazeem Sanjo; Edem, Victory Fabian; Okwor, Vitalis Chukwuemeka"
Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status,"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.",2020,Infect Genet Evol,"Abd El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed; Stockand, James D"

"Attitudes and Psychological Factors Associated With News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors Among US Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","Importance: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, it is critical to understand the psychological factors associated with pandemic-related behaviors. This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (ß = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (ß = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (ß = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (ß = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (ß = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (ß = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (ß = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (ß = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.",2020,JAMA pediatr.

Evaluación del tratamiento combinado de dexametasona y tocilizumab sobre parámetros hematológicos en pacientes con enfermedad crónica COVID-19,"Antecedentes y objetivo: La forma más eficaz de controlar la gravedad y la tasa de mortalidad de la enfermedad del nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19) es mediante enfoques de diagnóstico sensibles y un protocolo de tratamiento adecuado. Nuestro objetivo fue identificar el efecto de agregar corticosteroides y tocilizumab a un protocolo de tratamiento estándar en el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19 con enfermedad crónica a través de biomarcadores hematológicos y de laboratorio. Materiales y métodos: Este estudio se realizó de forma retrospectiva en 68 pacientes COVID-19 con enfermedad crónica que fueron tratados por diferentes protocolos terapéuticos. Los pacientes se clasificaron en cuatro grupos: el grupo de control representaba los resultados de laboratorio de los pacientes en el momento de la admisión antes de que se aplicaran los protocolos de tratamiento; el grupo 1 incluyó a pacientes tratados con anticoagulantes, Hidroxicloroquina y antibióticos; el grupo 2 estaba compuesto por pacientes tratados con Dexametasona; y el grupo 3 incluyó a pacientes tratados con Dexametasona y Tocilizumab. Resultados: Los recuentos de glóbulos blancos y neutrófilos aumentaron significativamente en el grupo 3 tras el tratamiento cuando se compararon con los pacientes del grupo 1 (p= 0,004 y p= 0,001, respectivamente). La comparación del nivel de proteína C reactiva (CRP) al ingreso fue mayor en el grupo 3 que en el grupo 1 con p= 0.030. Después de 10 días de tratamiento, el nivel de CRP disminuyó en todos los grupos, pero en el grupo 3 fue estadísticamente significativo (p= 0,002). Conclusión: El estudio allana el camino hacia la eficacia de la combinación de dexametasona con tocilizumab en el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19 con enfermedades crónicas. Background and aim: The most effective way to control severity and mortality rate of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is through sensitive diagnostic approaches and an appropriate treatment protocol. We aimed to identify the effect of adding corticosteroid and Tocilizumab to a standard treatment protocol in treating COVID-19 patients with chronic disease through hematological and lab biomarkers. Materials and methods: This study was performed retrospectively on 68 COVID-19 patients with chronic disease who were treated by different therapeutic protocols. The patients were categorized into four groups: control group represented the patients’ lab results at admission before treatment protocols were applied; group 1 included patients treated with anticoagulants, Hydroxychloroquine, and antibiotics; group 2 comprised patients treated with Dexamethasone; and group 3 included patients treated with Dexamethasone and Tocilizumab. Results: The WBC and neutrophil counts were increased significantly in group 3 upon the treatment when they were compared with patients in group 1 (p= 0.004 and p= 0.001, respectively). The comparison of C-reactive Protein (CRP) level at admission was higher in group 3 than in group 1 with p= 0.030. After 10 days of treatment, CRP level was decreased in all groups, but in group 3 it was statistically significant (p= 0.002).

Estimating Clinically Relevant Cut-Off Values for a High-Throughput Quantitative Real-Time PCR Detecting Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens in Cattle,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) results from interactions between pathogens, environmental stressors, and host factors. Obtaining a diagnosis of the causal pathogens is challenging but the use of high-throughput real-time PCR (rtPCR) may help target preventive and therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study was to improve the interpretation of rtPCR results by analysing their associations with clinical observations. The objective was to develop and illustrate a field-data driven statistical method to guide the selection of relevant quantification cycle cut-off values for pathogens associated with BRD for the high-throughput rtPCR system “Fluidigm BioMark HD” based on nasal swabs from calves. We used data from 36 herds enrolled in a Danish field study where 340 calves within pre-determined age-groups were subject to clinical examination and nasal swabs up to four times. The samples were analysed with the rtPCR system. Each of the 1,025 observation units were classified as sick with BRD or healthy, based on clinical scores. The optimal rtPCR results to predict BRD were investigated for Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Trueperella pyogenes by interpreting scatterplots and results of mixed effects logistic regression models. The clinically relevant rtPCR cut-off suggested for P. multocida and M. bovis was ≤ 21.3. For H. somni it was ≤ 17.4, while no cut-off could be determined for M. haemolytica and T. pyogenes. The demonstrated approach can provide objective support in the choice of clinically relevant cut-offs. However, for robust performance of the regression model sufficient amounts of suitable data are required.",2021-05-25,Front Vet Sci,"Klompmaker, Alicia F.; Brydensholt, Maria; Michelsen, Anne Marie; Denwood, Matthew J.; Kirkeby, Carsten T.; Larsen, Lars Erik; Goecke, Nicole B.; Otten, Nina D.; Nielsen, Liza R."
IoT to monitor people flow in areas of public interest,"The unexpected historical period we are living has abruptly pushed us to loosen any sort of interaction between individuals, gradually forcing us to deal with new ways to allow compliance with safety distances; indeed the present situation has demonstrated more than ever how critical it is to be able to properly organize our travel plans, put people in safe conditions, and avoid harmful circumstances. The aim of this research is to set up a system to monitor the flow of people inside public places and facilities of interest (museums, theatres, cinemas, etc.) without collecting personal or sensitive data. Weak monitoring of people flows (i.e. monitoring without personal identification of the monitored subjects) through Internet of Things tools might be a viable solution to minimize lineups and overcrowding. Our study, which began as an experiment in the Umbria region of Italy, aims to be one of several answers to automated planning of people's flows in order to make our land more liveable. We intend to show that the Internet of Things gives almost unlimited tools and possibilities, from developing a basic information process to implementing a true portal which enables business people to connect with interested consumers.",2021-11-03,,"Perri, Damiano; Simonetti, Marco; Bordini, Alex; Cimarelli, Simone; Gervasi, Osvaldo"
In silico prediction of new mutations that can improve the binding abilities between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and human ACE2,"The 2019-nCoV coronavirus protein was confirmed to be highly susceptible to various mutations, which can trigger apparent changes of virus' transmission capacity and even the pathogenic mechanism. In this article, the binding interface was obtained by analyzing the interaction modes between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human specific target protein ACE2. Based on the ""SIFT server"" and the ""bubble"" identification mechanism, 9 amino acid sites were selected as potential mutation-sites from the 2019-nCoV-S1-ACE2 binding interface. Subsequently, one total number of 171 mutant systems for 9 mutation-sites were optimized for binding-pattern comparsion analysis, and 14 mutations that may improve the binding capacity of 2019-nCoV-S1 to ACE2 were selected. The Molecular Dynamic Simulations were conducted to calculate the binding free energies of all 14 mutant systems. Finally, we found that most of the 14 mutations on the 2019-nCoV-S1 protein could enhance the binding ability between the 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human protein ACE2. Among which, the binding capacities for G446R, Y449R and F486Y mutations could be increased by 20%, and that for S494R mutant increased even by 38.98%. We hope this research could provide significant help for the future epidemic detection, drug development research, and vaccine development and administration.",2021,IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

Corporate sponsorship for museums in times of crisis,"The COVID-19 pandemic causes museums to seek financial aid from corporate sponsors. However, corporate sponsorship may have negative consequences for museums in terms of their authenticity. In this study, we therefore examine whether the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 crisis change tourists' perceptions of corporate sponsorship. Indeed, we find that tourists react more positively to corporate sponsorship if the health crisis is salient. Moreover, we show that corporate sponsorship by multiple smaller- and medium-sized companies generates more positive outcomes for museums than the effort of a single large company, in terms of perceived authenticity loss, visiting intentions, and willingness to pay.",2020-09-30,Ann Tour Res,"Biraglia, Alessandro; Gerrath, Maximilian H.E.E."

Stance detection with BERT embeddings for credibility analysis of information on social media,"The evolution of electronic media is a mixed blessing. Due to the easy access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious problem that causes disputes and endangers the societal stability and harmony. Fake news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature. proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news, paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of the news at the early stage i.e., when the news is published but is yet to be disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary, we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment conducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the previous work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.",2021-04-14,PeerJ Comput Sci,"Karande, Hema; Walambe, Rahee; Benjamin, Victor; Kotecha, Ketan; Raghu, TS"
Lessons from the pandemic on the value of research infrastructure,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shed a spotlight on the resilience of healthcare systems, and their ability to cope efficiently and effectively with unexpected crises. If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding. Developing a framework to fully account for option value, and understanding the public appetite to pay for it, should allow us to be better prepared for the next emerging problem.",2021,Health Res Policy Syst,"Roope, Laurence S J; Candio, Paolo; Kiparoglou, Vasiliki; McShane, Helen; Duch, Raymond; Clarke, Philip M"
Long-term prognosis of preserved useful hearing after surgery in patients with vestibular schwannoma: a study of 91 cases.,"BACKGROUND In patients with a vestibular schwannoma, some studies have reported that useful hearing preserved initially after surgery deteriorates gradually in the long term. Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients. This study, which analyzed one of the largest series of vestibular schwannoma patients, demonstrated that retrocochlear condition is a key factor for useful hearing maintenance. In patients with vestibular schwannoma who have preserved hearing function, regular postoperative monitoring of hearing function is as important as regular MRI.",2020-08-15,Acta neurochirurgica,"Ichimasu, Norio; Kohno, Michihiro; Nakajima, Nobuyuki; Matsushima, Ken; Tanaka, Yujiro; Tsukahara, Kiyoaki; Inagaki, Taro; Yoshino, Masanori; Nagata, Osamu"
COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity.

Out Of Reach: Inequities In The Use Of High-Quality Home Health Agencies,"Patients receiving home health services from high-quality home health agencies often experience fewer adverse outcomes (for example, hospitalizations) than patients receiving services from low-quality agencies. Using administrative data from 2016 and regression analysis, we examined individual- and neighborhood-level racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors associated with the use of high-quality home health agencies. We found that Black and Hispanic home health patients had a 2.2-percentage-point and a 2.5-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use, respectively, compared with their White counterparts within the same neighborhoods. Low-income patients had a 1.2-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use compared with their higher-income counterparts, whereas home health patients residing in neighborhoods with higher proportions of marginalized residents had a lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use. Some 40–77 percent of the disparities in high-quality agency use were attributable to neighborhood-level factors. Ameliorating these inequities will require policies that dismantle structural and institutional barriers related to residential segregation.",2022-02-03,Health Aff (Millwood),"Fashaw-Walters, Shekinah A.; Rahman, Momotazur; Gee, Gilbert; Mor, Vincent; White, Michael; Thomas, Kali S."
"Impacts of COVID-19 on sexual behaviour in Britain: findings from a large, quasi-representative survey (Natsal-COVID)","OBJECTIVES: Physical restrictions imposed to combat COVID-19 dramatically altered sexual lifestyles but the specific impacts on sexual behaviour are still emerging. We investigated physical and virtual sexual activities, sexual frequency and satisfaction in the 4 months following lockdown in Britain in March 2020 and compared with pre-lockdown. METHODS: Weighted analyses of web panel survey data collected July/August 2020 from a quota-based sample of 6654 people aged 18–59 years in Britain. Multivariable regression took account of participants’ opportunity for partnered sex, gender and age, to examine their independent associations with perceived changes in sexual frequency and satisfaction. RESULTS: Most participants (86.7%) reported some form of sex following lockdown with physical activities more commonly reported than virtual activities (83.7% vs 52.6%). Altogether, 63.2% reported sex with someone (‘partnered sex’) since lockdown, three-quarters of whom were in steady cohabiting relationships. With decreasing relationship formality, partnered sex was less frequently reported, while masturbation, sex toy use and virtual activities were more frequently reported. Around half of all participants perceived no change in partnered sex frequency compared with the 3 months pre-lockdown, but this was only one-third among those not cohabiting, who were more likely to report increases in non-partnered activities than those cohabiting. Two-thirds of participants perceived no change in sexual satisfaction; declines were more common among those not cohabiting. Relationship informality and younger age were independently associated with perceiving change, often declines, in sexual frequency and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our quasi-representative study of the British population found a substantial minority reported significant shifts in sexual repertoires, frequency and satisfaction following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. However, these negative changes were perceived by some more than others; predominantly those not cohabiting and the young. As these groups are most likely to experience adverse sexual health, it is important to monitor behaviour as restrictions ease to understand the longer term consequences, including for health services.",2021-12-14,Sex Transm Infect,"Mercer, Catherine H; Clifton, Soazig; Riddell, Julie; Tanton, Clare; Freeman, Lily; Copas, Andrew J; Dema, Emily; Bosó Pérez, Raquel; Gibbs, Jo; Macdowall, Wendy; Menezes, Dee; Ridge, Mary-Clare; Bonell, Chris; Sonnenberg, Pam; Field, Nigel; Mitchell, Kirstin R"
Experiencing graduated intimacies during lockdown (Fengcheng): A reflexive and comparative approach to the COVID-19 pandemic in urban China,"In this article, I examine the ways in which the recent, nationwide ‘lockdown’ (fengcheng) in China, caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, has abruptly reshaped daily intimacy practices of urban residents Highlighting the lockdown in a southeast coastal city in the broader context of China’s post-socialist transformations, I propose that class distinctions have profoundly reconfigured local citizens’ daily experiences, producing a system of what might be termed ‘graduated intimacies’ To further contextualize these urban citizens’ experiences of intimacy under the current transnational geo-biopolitics associated with the pandemic, I provide a reflexive and comparative ethnographic look at the national capital of Beĳing In so doing, I offer a glimpse into the lives of several sets of Chinese citizens at an unexpected historical moment induced by a grave public health crisis extending well beyond China’s national borders © Berghahn Books and the Association for Anthropology in Action",2020,Anthropology in Action,"Chen, J."
An identity conflict perspective on female expatriate work adjustment,"PurposeThis study aims to develop a model for female expatriate work adjustment from the identity conflict perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis is a theoretical paper that focuses on integrating the existing literature and proposing new constructive relationships.FindingsWe study female expatriates' adjustment processes in the work domain from the identity conflict perspective. Specifically, we categorize female expatriates' identities in the work domain into their gender identity and a work-related role identity cluster and propose that when gender identity is salient, unsupportive national and organizational cultures will lead to gender–work role identity conflicts and eventually result in maladjustment in the work domain.Originality/valueFirst, we suggest that female expatriates' work role identities can form a cluster that includes expatriate role, managerial role and occupational role identity. We further theorize how the gender role identity and the work-related role identity cluster of female expatriates interact to influence how they adjust to their work. Second, we explore two contingency factors – host organizational culture and host national culture–and explain how they influence the interaction between female expatriates' gender identity and work-related role identities. Finally, we introduce the concept of gender–work role identity conflict and theorize how it serves as the underlying mechanism linking female expatriate identity patterns and work adjustment.",2021,Journal of Global Mobility,"Lu, Yu Ren Hong"

GeoGebra Integration in Elementary Initial Teacher Training: The Case of 3-D Shapes,"The integration of technology in learning is increasingly popular and inevitable, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. In mathematics education, Geogebra has been used as a pedagogical tool in learning mathematics from elementary to university. The present study aims to explore first-year prospective elementary teachers' experience constructing 3-D shapes using GeoGebra. This study uses a case study method with 40 first-year prospective elementary teachers from an elementary initial teacher training from a public university in Riau, Indonesia. The participants worked in small groups and discussed some 3-D shapes through an online platform, and in the end, each participant reflected their attitudes towards the integration of GeoGebra in learning 3-D shapes. The findings show that prospective elementary teachers discussed six types of 3-D shapes;cube, rectangular prism, rectangular pyramid, cylinder, cone, and spheres. They prefer to discuss curved surfaces rather than flat surfaces of 3-D shapes. In addition, prospective elementary teachers have positive attitudes towards integrating GeoGebra in elementary initial teacher training. They believe that GeoGebra supports them to understand better the concepts of volume and surface area of 3-D shapes, facilitate students to understand the properties of a geometry object, and compare the object one made using hand drawing to using GeoGebra. Meanwhile, difficulty in using the tools to construct 3-D shapes in GeoGebra becomes a hinder to understand mathematics concepts and properties. The implication of this study is that there is a potential to integrate GeoGebra in mathematics learning in elementary teacher training. © 2021.

Understanding the phase separation characteristics of nucleocapsid protein provides a new therapeutic opportunity against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",2020-10-09,bioRxiv,"Zhao, Dan; Xu, Weifan; Zhang, Xiaofan; Wang, Xiaoting; Yuan, Enming; Xiong, Yuanpeng; Wu, Shenyang; Li, Shuya; Wu, Nian; Tian, Tingzhong; Feng, Xiaolong; Shu, Hantao; Lang, Peng; Shen, Xiaokun; Li, Haitao; Li, Pilong; Zeng, Jianyang"
Association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load at admission with in-hospital acute kidney injury: A retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI.

Salt-dependent hypertension and inflammation: targeting the gut-brain axis and the immune system with Brazilian green propolis,"Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is a major health problem around the world and its development has been associated with exceeding salt consumption by the modern society. The mechanisms by which salt consumption increase blood pressure (BP) involve several homeostatic systems but many details have not yet been fully elucidated. Evidences accumulated over the last 60 decades raised the involvement of the immune system in the hypertension development and opened a range of possibilities for new therapeutic targets. Green propolis is a promising natural product with potent anti-inflammatory properties acting on specific targets, most of them participating in the gut-brain axis of the sodium-dependent hypertension. New anti-hypertensive products reinforce the therapeutic arsenal improving the corollary of choices, especially in those cases where patients are resistant or refractory to conventional therapy. This review sought to bring the newest advances in the field articulating evidences that show a cross-talking between inflammation and the central mechanisms involved with the sodium-dependent hypertension as well as the stablished actions of green propolis and some of its biologically active compounds on the immune cells and cytokines that would be involved with its anti-hypertensive properties.",2020,Inflammopharmacology,"Batista, Marcos Adriano Carlos; Braga, Daiane Cristina de Assis; de Moura, Sandra Aparecida Lima; de Souza, Gustavo Henrique Bianco; Dos Santos, Orlando David Henrique; Cardoso, Leonardo Máximo"
AP-MALDI mass spectrometry of engine oil additive components,"RATIONALE The efficiency of lubricants strongly depends on the content of functional additives. In order to assess the chemical and structural changes taking place in the lubricating oil and its additives during operation it is essential to develop a method for simple and prompt analysis, which is described in this study. METHODS: Two single additives as well as a fully formulated engine oil were analysed using an atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-MALDI) ion source coupled to a Linear Trap Quadrupole Orbitrap XL hybrid tandem mass spectrometer and compared with results obtained by means of electrospray ionization including additional low energy collision induced dissociation (LE-CID). The identification of additives directly from technical surfaces were simulated by using steel substrates as AP-MALDI target with varying roughness. RESULTS: After assessment and selection of the most suited AP-MALDI matrix it has been found that pure additives such as calcium sulfonate and zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP) could well be identified with abundant signal intensity based on their elemental composition. Molecule identification was corroborated by LE-CID in electrospray ionization mode. Additionally, additives present in the fully formulated commercial oil such as ZDDP and salicylates could be reliably identified based on the elemental composition of the deprotonated molecules by means of the Orbitrap unit on different substrates including steel surfaces with high roughness. CONCLUSIONS: Atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization is an efficient technique for determination of lubricant additives directly from commercial oil blends. Identification of additive components was also achieved on steel surfaces with high roughness as applied in tribological systems and thus, it is expected that additive degradation will be possible to be assessed in real applications, enabling more effective and timely maintenance measures.",2022,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,"Ramopoulou, Lamprini; Widder, Lukas; Brenner, Josef; Ristic, Andjelka; Allmaier, Günter"

Treatment for breast cancer patients during the special period of novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak,"Abstract Purpose: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred worldwide. 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can be transmitted from human to human, cause hospital infection, and seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. The treatment of patients with breast cancer may be affected in this special period. Methods: From 24th January to 8th March 2020, patients diagnosed with breast cancer were enrolled from 16 hospitals in Jiangsu Province, and patients, who were candidates for surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were also enrolled. Patients from 24th January to 8th March 2019 were included as control with the same criteria. Results: In 2019, 520 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in these 16 hospital;however, only 229 patients (decreased by 56%) were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period of 2020. The clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups, and core biopsy was performed to more patients in 2020 than that in 2019 (4.1 days ±3.2 vs 3.2 days ±2.6, P < 0.001), and more patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection in 2020. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the mean interval between last time of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in 2020 was significantly longer than that in 2019 (29.2 days ±11.1 vs 17.7 days ±8.2, P < 0.001). After examinations to rule out COVID-19, no COVID-19 was found in any patient. Conclusions: In the special period of novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, the treatment of patients with breast cancer was delayed, but the treatment was safe after strict exclusions of COVID-19.",2020,,"Zhou, Wenbin Wang Shui Pan Hong Xie Hui Zhang Jiaxin Zhen Linlin Zhang Chunhui Fang Qi Cao Susheng Liu Xiao Fu Deyuan Guan Xiaoqing Jiang Guoqin Xu Lingyun Shen Enchao Geng Qiang Xiao Xiudi Gu Jun Yi Tongbo Liu Xiaoan"
Financial Toxicity in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Proton Therapy,"Cancer-related financial toxicity impacts head and neck cancer patients and survivors. With increasing use of proton therapy as a curative treatment for head and neck cancer, the multifaceted financial and economic implications of proton therapy—dimensions of “financial toxicity”—need to be addressed. Herein, we identify knowledge gaps and potential solutions related to the problem of financial toxicity. To date, while cost-effectiveness analysis has been used to assess the value of proton therapy for head and neck cancer, it may not fully incorporate empiric comparisons of patients' and survivors' lost productivity and disability after treatment. A cost-of-illness framework for evaluation could address this gap, thereby more comprehensively identifying the value of proton therapy and distinctly incorporating a measurable aspect of financial toxicity in evaluation. Overall, financial toxicity burdens remain understudied in head and neck cancer patients from a patient-centered perspective. Systematic, validated, and accurate measurement of financial toxicity in patients receiving proton therapy is needed, especially relative to conventional photon-based strategies. This will enrich the evidence base for optimal selection and rationale for payer coverage of available treatment options for head and neck cancer patients. In the setting of cancer care delivery, a combination of conducting proactive screening for financial toxicity in patients selected for proton therapy, initiating early financial navigation in vulnerable patients, engaging stakeholders, improving oncology provider team cost communication, expanding policies to promote price transparency, and expanding insurance coverage for proton therapy are critical practices to mitigate financial toxicity in head and neck cancer patients.",2021-06-25,Int J Part Ther,"Smith, Grace L.; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina; Frank, Steven J."
COVID-19 information-Tracking solutions: A qualitative investigation of the factors influencing people's adoption intention,"Numerous information-Tracking solutions have been implemented worldwide to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. While prior work has heavily explored the factors affecting people's willingness to adopt contact-Tracing solutions, which inform people when they have been exposed to someone positive for COVID-19, numerous countries have implemented other information-Tracking solutions that use more data and more sensitive data than these commonly studied contact-Tracing apps. In this work, we build on existing work focused on contact-Tracing apps to explore adoption and design considerations for six representative information-Tracking solutions for COVID-19, which differ in their goals and in the types of information they collect. To do so, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 44 participants to investigate the factors that influence their willingness to adopt these solutions. We find four main categories of influences on participants' willingness to adopt such solutions: individual benefits of the solution, societal benefits of the solution, functionality concern, and digital safety (e.g., security and privacy) concerns. Further, we enumerate the factors that inform participants' evaluations of these categories. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for the future design of information-Tracking solutions and discuss how different factors may balance against benefits in future crisis situations. © 2022 ACM.",2022,"7th ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval, CHIIR 2022","Huang, Y.; Obada-Obieh, B.; Redmiles, E.

Adversarial Mask: Real-World Adversarial Attack Against Face Recognition Models,"Deep learning-based facial recognition (FR) models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the past few years, even when wearing protective medical face masks became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the outstanding performance of these models, the machine learning research community has shown increasing interest in challenging their robustness. Initially, researchers presented adversarial attacks in the digital domain, and later the attacks were transferred to the physical domain. However, in many cases, attacks in the physical domain are conspicuous, requiring, for example, the placement of a sticker on the face, and thus may raise suspicion in real-world environments (e.g., airports). In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mask, a physical adversarial universal perturbation (UAP) against state-of-the-art FR models that is applied on face masks in the form of a carefully crafted pattern. In our experiments, we examined the transferability of our adversarial mask to a wide range of FR model architectures and datasets. In addition, we validated our adversarial mask effectiveness in real-world experiments by printing the adversarial pattern on a fabric medical face mask, causing the FR system to identify only 3.34% of the participants wearing the mask (compared to a minimum of 83.34% with other evaluated masks).",2021,,"Zolfi, Alon Avidan Shai Elovici Yuval Shabtai Asaf"
Incineration of sewage sludge and recovery of residue ash as building material: A valuable option as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Circular economy principles were adopted by European Commission, to support a sustainable growth. They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach. This work aims to be not only a reference paper for promotion of strategies able to increase waste management safety, but also an example showing that circular economy principles should be pursued also if boundary conditions can change.",2021,J Environ Manage,"Ducoli, S; Zacco, A; Bontempi, E"
High Levels of CD244 Rather Than CD160 Associate With CD8(+) T-Cell Aging,"Aging leads to functional dysregulation of the immune system, especially T cell defects. Previous studies have shown that the accumulation of co-inhibitory molecules plays an essential role in both T cell exhaustion and aging. In the present study, we showed that CD244 and CD160 were both up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells of elderly individuals. CD244(+)CD160(-) CD8(+) T cells displayed the increased activity of β-GAL, higher production of cytokines, and severe metabolic disorders, which were characteristics of immune aging. Notably, the functional dysregulation associated with aging was reversed by blocking CD244 instead of CD160. Meanwhile, CD244(+)CD160(+) CD8(+) T cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including lower levels of cytokine, impaired proliferation, and intrinsic transcriptional regulation, compared to CD244(+)CD160(-) population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CD244 rather than CD160 acts as a prominent regulator involved in T cell aging, providing a solid therapeutic target to improve disorders and comorbidities correlated to immune system aging.",2022-03-21,Front Immunol,"Wang, Xinyue; Wang, Di; Du, Juan; Wei, Yuqing; Song, Rui; Wang, Beibei; Qiu, Shuang; Li, Bei; Zhang, Leidan; Zeng, Yongqin; Zhao, Hongxin; Kong, Yaxian"
Comparison of CLEIA and ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 Virus Antibodies after First and Second Dose Vaccinations with the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine,"The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has required rapid action to control its spread and vaccines are a fundamental solution to this pandemic. The development of rapid and reliable serological tests to monitor the antibody response to coronavirus disease vaccines is necessary for post-vaccination immune responses. Therefore, in this study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers after the first and second doses were monitored using two different measurement systems, a highly sensitive analytical platform of chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our study included 121 participants who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Both methods show significant increase in anti-spike protein IgG antibody levels one week after the first vaccination, and then reached at a plateau at week five (week two after the second dose), with a 3.8 ×103-fold rise in CLEIA and a 22-fold rise in ELISA. CLEIA and ELISA showed a good correlation in the high titer range, >10 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL. Both methods detected higher IgG antibody levels in females compared with male participants after the second vaccination, while CLEIA exhibits the sex difference after the first dose. Thus, our study showed better performance of CLEIA over ELISA in sensitivity, especially in the low concentration range, however ELISA was also useful in the high titer range (>10 BAU/mL) corresponding to the level seen several weeks after the first vaccination.",2022,Vaccines,"Ashenagar, Mohammad Said Matsumoto Akiko Sakai Hironori Tokiya Mikiko Hara Megumi Hirota Yoshio"
Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Semen and Effect on Total Sperm Number: A Prospective Observational Study,"PURPOSE: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a surge of research to help better understand the breadth of possible sequelae. However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting.

Intravitreal application of epidermal growth factor in non-exudative age-related macular degeneration.,"PURPOSE To assess the safety of intravitreally applied epidermal growth factor (EGF). METHODS The clinical interventional, prospective, single-centre, case series study included patients with age-related macular degeneration-related geographic atrophy (GA), in whom the eye with the worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) underwent a single, or repeated, intravitreal injection of EGF (0.75 µg in 50 µL). At baseline and afterwards, the eyes underwent ophthalmological examinations. RESULTS The study included seven patients (mean age:70.0±12.2 years (range: 54-86 years), with five patients receiving a single injection and two patients receiving two intravitreal injections in an interval of 4 weeks. Mean duration of follow-up was 97±97 days (median:35 days; range: 7-240 days). Mean BCVA was lower at baseline than at study end (1.41±0.44 logMAR vs 0.97±0.12 logMAR; p=0.03). Mean size of the GA lesions did not differ significantly between baseline and study end (29 212±22 887 pixels vs 29 300±22 905 pixels; p=0.59) nor did the mean perimetric mean defect (-10.3±5.9 dB vs 12.0±8.8 dB; p=0.35) or the electroretinographical b-wave amplitude (44.53±31.7 µV vs 64.5±25.5 µV; p=0.12). After a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection, one of two patients developed a cystoid macular oedema in association with an induced incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. It persisted for 3 weeks. Visual acuity in this eye improved from 1.0 logMAR at baseline to 0.80 logMAR at study end. CONCLUSIONS Except for one eye with temporary, self-resolving cystoid macular oedema, single and repeated intravitreal applications of EGF (0.75 µg) in patients with GA did not lead to intraocular inflammations or any observed intraocular side effect.

Circulating Type I Interferon Levels in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Are Associated With the Development of Respiratory Failure,"BACKGROUND: The role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the early phase of COVID-19 remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between IFN-I levels in patients with COVID-19 and clinical presentation, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and other major pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: This prospective observational study recruited patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α), interferon-beta (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10) within 5 days after symptom onset were measured using an ELISA, in serum from blood collected within 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was determined via qPCR using nasal-swab specimens and serum. RESULTS: The study enrolled 50 patients with COVID-19. IFN-α levels were significantly higher in patients who presented with pneumonia or developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (p < 0.001). Furthermore, IFN-α levels were associated with viral load in nasal-swab specimens and RNAemia (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant association between IFN-β levels and the presence of pneumonia or RNAemia, despite showing a stronger association with nasal-swab viral load (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that the serum levels of IFN-α significantly correlated with those of IFN-β, IL-6, and CXCL10, while the levels of IFN-β did not correlate with those of IL-6 or CXCL10. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IFN-I levels in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher in patients who developed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The association between IFN-α, IL-6, and CXCL10 may reflect the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 invasion into pulmonary circulation, which might be an early predictor of respiratory failure due to COVID-19.",2022-02-14,Front Immunol,"Nagaoka, Kentaro; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Murai, Yushi; Kaneda, Makito; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Fukui, Yasutaka; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro"

Vitamin D Supplementation in COVID-19 Patients: A Clinical Case Series,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 4.4 million people and caused more than 300,000 deaths partly through acute respiratory distress syndrome with propensity to affect African American and Hispanic communities disproportionately. Patients with worse outcomes have exhibited higher blood plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of the vitamin D receptor expressed on immune cells has been shown to directly reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and indirectly affect C-reactive protein. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The significance of the vitamin D pathway in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION: Vitamin D supplementation in patients after diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: We report 4 vitamin D deficient patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 who were provided with either cholecalciferol of 1000 IU daily (standard dose) or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU daily for 5 days (high dose) as part of supplementation. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Patients that received a high dose of vitamin D supplementation achieved normalization of vitamin D levels and improved clinical recovery evidenced by shorter lengths of stay, lower oxygen requirements, and a reduction in inflammatory marker status. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may serve as a viable alternative for curtailing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients in underserved communities where resources to expensive and sought-after medications may be scarce. Randomized clinical trials will serve as an appropriate vessel to validate the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen and dissection of the pathway.",2020-08-13,Am J Ther,"Ohaegbulam, Kim C.; Swalih, Mohamed; Patel, Pranavkumar; Smith, Miriam A.; Perrin, Richard"
Protocol: A mixed methods evaluation of an IPS program to increase employment and well-being for people with long-term experience of complex barriers in Vancouver’s downtown and DTES,"BACKGROUND: Employment improves mental health and well-being by providing financial security, daily structure, a sense of identity and purpose, and social engagement. However, securing and sustaining employment is exceptionally challenging for vulnerable populations who experience persistent and multiple barriers, such as mental illness, homelessness, food and housing insecurity, and marginalization. Evidence-based supported employment programs, most notably individual placement and support (IPS) are becoming a more common approach for addressing the needs of these high-risk individuals. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating an IPS program in Vancouver’s downtown and Downtown Eastside (DTES). METHODS AND DESIGN: This prospective quasi-experimental study of persons with persistent and multiple barriers to employment will use a mixed-methods approach for evaluating a novel IPS program. The evaluation will consist of survey packages and interviews that will capture outcomes related to employment and well-being, as well as the experiential process of receiving individualized and integrated supports through the IPS program. A mixed-methods approach is appropriate for this study as quantitative data will provide an objective assessment of program impacts on employment and well-being outcomes over time, while qualitative data will provide an in-depth understanding of continued barriers and experiences. DISCUSSION: The results from this evaluation will contribute evidence within a local British Columbian (BC) context that may increase access to meaningful employment for those with long-term experience of complex barriers to employment. Further, the findings will support continued improvements, and guide decision-making around practices and policy for future implementation of IPS and employment supports across BC.",2021-12-16,PLoS One,"Kwan, Amanda; Morris, Jonny; Barbic, Skye P."

Cyber Security in Cloud: Risk Assessment Models,"The present paper shows a proposal of the characteristics Cloud Risk Assessment Models should have and presents the review of the literature considering those characteristics in order to identify current gaps. This work shows a ranking of Cloud RA models and their degree of compliance with the theoretical reference Cloud Risk Assessment model. The review of literature shows that RA approaches leveraging CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) STAR Registry that have into account organizations security requirements present higher degree of compliance, but they still lack risk economic quantification. The myriad of conceptual models, methodologies and frameworks although based on current NIST SP 800:30, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, ISO 30001, ENISA standards could be enhanced by the use of techno-economic models like UTEM, created by the author, in order to conceive more simplified models for effective Risk Assessment and Mitigation closer to the theoretical reference model for Cloud Risk Assessment, available for all cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and easy to use for all stakeholders.",2021-06-19,,"Bendicho, Carlos"
The Interaction of Water-Soluble Nitroxide Radicals with Photosystem II,"In this work, we investigated the redox transients of a number of water-soluble spin labels upon their interactions with Photosystem II (PS II) core complexes isolated from spinach leaves. We have found that the reactivity of nitroxide radicals, determined by the rate of their reduction upon illumination of PS II, depends on the chemical structure of radicals and the capability of their coming close to low-potential redox centers of photoactive PS II complexes. An enhanced capability of nitroxide radicals to accept electrons from PS II correlates with their chemical structure. Nitroxide radicals NTI (2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-nitromethylene-3-imidazolidine-N-oxyl) and Tacet (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-acetate), containing polar groups, appear to be most efficient acceptors of electrons donated by PS II compared to neutral (TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) or positively charged (Tamine, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl) spin labels. We assume that enhanced reactivities of polar nitroxide radicals, NTI and Tacet, are determined (1) by their relatively high redox potentials, providing the possibility to accept electrons from PS II, and (2) by their affinities to the closest binding sites on the surface of PS II in the vicinity of the primary plastoquinone acceptor PQ(A) (12–14 Å) or/and in the intraprotein cavity for the secondary plastoquinone PQ(B) (~ 22 Å).",2021-09-09,Appl Magn Reson,"Trubitsin, B.

[Analysis of the changes and characteristics of pediatric outpatient visits in a general hospital in Beijing before and after the COVID-19 pandemic].,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the changes and characteristics of pediatric outpatient visits in a general hospital before and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS Based on the registration data of pediatric outpatient visits in the information system (HIS)of Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, from January 1 2018 to December 31 2020, aged 0 to 16 years, we analyzed the changes of outpatient visits before and after the epidemic, focusing on respiratory infection including influenza. The relationship between the outpatient visits and age and quarterly distribution were also studied. RESULTS (1) Respiratory infection accounted for the majority of outpatient visits in 2018 and 2019 (60.6% and 60.5%, respectively). Non-respiratory infection accounted for the main proportion of outpatient visits in 2020, while respiratory infection accounted for only 47.4%. Annual respiratory infection visits, respiratory infectious diseases visits especially influenza visits all decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2018 and 2019 (P < 0.05). (2)Respiratory infection visits were highest in the infant group, lowest in the school age group (P < 0.05) and highest in the fourth quarter each year. It decreased significantly in the second quarter of 2020 with statistical significance when compared with the other quarters of 2020(P < 0.05). (3)Influenza accounted for the highest proportion of respiratory infectious diseases visits in each year. It was highest in first quarter, which was significantly different from the other quarters of the year (P < 0.05). There were different distributions of influenza visits throughout 2018 and 2019, while it was only distributed in the first quarter and 99% in January in 2020. CONCLUSION The respiratory infection and influenza visits have decreased significantly in our pediatric outpatient department after the COVID-19 epidemic, which is considered closely related to the lifestyle and personal protection after the epidemic. It is recommended that health education on respiratory infection and influenza prevention should be strengthened, especially in winter and spring, to promote the development of good respiratory and hand hygiene habits.",2021-10-18,Beijing da xue xue bao.

"NIMO-CKD-UK: a real-world, observational study of iron isomaltoside in patients with iron deficiency anaemia and chronic kidney disease","BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron is often used to treat iron deficiency anaemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD), but the optimal dosing regimen remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators’ discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

Tripartite-motif protein 30 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating reactive oxygen species production.,"The NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is critical for caspase-1 activation and the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β. However, the mechanism that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that tripartite-motif protein 30 (TRIM30) negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. After stimulation with ATP, an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome, knockdown of TRIM30 enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased production of IL-1β in both J774 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30 increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production triggered by other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked excess IL-1β production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1β production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in maintaining inflammatory responses.",2010,Journal of immunology,"Hu, Yu; Mao, Kairui; Zeng, Yan; Chen, Shuzhen; Tao, Zhiyun; Yang, Chen; Sun, Shuhui; Wu, Xiaodong; Meng, Guangxun; Sun, Bing"

"Impact of AmaTea® Max on physiological measures and gaming performance in active gamers: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The activity of “gaming” has increased greatly in popularity in recent years, with many gamers using nutritional supplements to aid mood and gaming performance. We evaluated the impact of AmaTea(®) Max (referred to as AmaTea(®) throughout; a patented dietary supplement consisting of a blend of caffeine and polyphenol antioxidants), compared to both caffeine and a placebo, on gaming and cognitive performance in active gamers. METHODS: Subjects reported to the lab on three occasions, separated by approximately 1 week. On each day, they had baseline measurements taken and then played the game Fortnite for four 1-h periods. Measures of cognitive performance, gaming performance, heart rate and blood pressure (BP), and blood cortisol were measured before and at selected times following gameplay. RESULTS: Neither caffeine nor AmaTea(®) impacted gaming or cognitive performance in a statistically significant manner. However, a trend (P=0.075) was noted for the condition effect for kills/match, with values 21% higher for AmaTea(®) (1.84) compared to placebo (1.51), and 12% higher for AmaTea(®) compared to caffeine (1.63). Subjective mood was relatively unaffected, although a condition effect was noted for jittery (P=0.05), with values lower for placebo than for caffeine (P=0.02). BP was minimally elevated with both AmaTea(®) and caffeine, while cortisol followed the normal diurnal variation and was lower for placebo than AmaTea(®) and caffeine. CONCLUSION: AmaTea(®) modestly increased kills/match during gameplay. It is possible that a different gaming stimulus, varied time of gameplay, or different dosage of the supplement may have yielded different results. RELEVANCE FOR SUBJECTS: Active gamers who seek to use a dietary supplement for purposes of gaming performance may benefit slightly from ingestion of AmaTea(®) before gameplay while experiencing greater vigor and lower fatigue as compared to placebo.",2022-03-01,J Clin Transl Res,"Bloomer, Richard J.; Martin, Keith R.; Pence, Jacquelyn C."
Predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children under general anaesthesia using dynamic parameters and transthoracic echocardiography.,"BACKGROUND Dynamic variables are accurate predictors of fluid responsiveness in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. They can be determined using respiratory variation in aortic flow peak velocity (▵Vpeak), arterial pulse pressure [▵PP and pulse pressure variation (PPV)], or plethysmographic waveform amplitude [▵POP and pleth variability index (PVI)]. These indices have not been validated in children. We studied the ability of these variables to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS All results are expressed as median [median absolute deviation (MAD)]. Thirty mechanically ventilated children were studied after undergoing general anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(-1) of body weight. ▵PP, PPV, ▵POP, PVI, ▵Vpeak, and aortic velocity-time integral were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Patients were considered to be responders to VE when the aortic velocity-time integral increased more than 15% after VE. RESULTS VE induced significant changes in ▵PP [13 (MAD 4) to 9 (5)%], PPV [15 (5) to 9 (5)%], ▵POP [15 (10) to 10 (6)%], PVI [13 (6) to 8 (5)%], and ▵Vpeak [16 (9) to 8 (3)%] (P<0.05 for all). Differences in ▵PP, ▵POP, PPV, and PVI did not reach statistical significance. Only ▵Vpeak was significantly different between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to VE [22 (3) vs 7 (1)%, respectively; P<0.001]. The threshold ▵Vpeak value of 10% allowed discrimination between R and NR. CONCLUSIONS In this study, ▵Vpeak was the most appropriate variable to predict fluid responsiveness.",2011,British journal of anaesthesia,"Pereira de Souza Neto, E; Grousson, S; Duflo, F; Ducreux, C; Joly, H; Convert, J; Mottolese, C; Dailler, F; Cannesson, M"
Neutralizing Antibodies and Antibody-Dependent Enhancement in COVID-19: A Perspective,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an alternative route of viral entry in the susceptible host cell. In this process, antiviral antibodies enhance the entry access of virus in the cells via interaction with the complement or Fc receptors leading to the worsening of infection. SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a general concern for the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that may fail to neutralize infection, raising the possibility of a more severe form of COVID-19. Data from various studies on respiratory viruses raise the speculation that antibodies elicited against SARS-CoV-2 and during COVID-19 recovery could potentially exacerbate the infection through ADE at sub-neutralizing concentrations; this may contribute to disease pathogenesis. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study the effectiveness of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19-infected subjects. Theoretically, ADE remains a general concern for the efficacy of antibodies elicited during infection, most notably in convalescent plasma therapy and in response to vaccines where it could be counterproductive.",2022-02-04,J Indian Inst Sci,"Ajmeriya, Swati; Kumar, Amit; Karmakar, Subhradip; Rana, Shweta; Singh, Harpreet"
DNA Methylation on N6-Adenine Regulates the Hyphal Development during Dimorphism in the Early-Diverging Fungus Mucor lusitanicus,"The epigenetic modifications control the pathogenicity of human pathogenic fungi, which have been poorly studied in Mucorales, causative agents of mucormycosis. This order belongs to a group referred to as early-diverging fungi that are characterized by high levels of N6-methyldeoxy adenine (6mA) in their genome with dense 6mA clusters associated with actively expressed genes. AlkB enzymes can act as demethylases of 6mA in DNA, with the most remarkable eukaryotic examples being mammalian ALKBH1 and Caenorhabditis elegans NMAD-1. The Mucor lusitanicus (formerly M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus) genome contains one gene, dmt1, and two genes, dmt2 and dmt3, encoding proteins similar to C. elegans NMAD-1 and ALKBH1, respectively. The function of these three genes was analyzed by the generation of single and double deletion mutants for each gene. Multiple processes were studied in the mutants, but defects were only found in single and double deletion mutants for dmt1. In contrast to the wild-type strain, dmt1 mutants showed an increase in 6mA levels during the dimorphic transition, suggesting that 6mA is associated with dimorphism in M. lusitanicus. Furthermore, the spores of dmt1 mutants challenged with macrophages underwent a reduction in polar growth, suggesting that 6mA also has a role during the spore–macrophage interaction that could be important in the infection process.",2021-09-08,J Fungi (Basel),"Osorio-Concepción, Macario; Lax, Carlos; Navarro, Eusebio; Nicolás, Francisco E.; Garre, Victoriano"

Determining the reliability of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in fully vaccinated individuals,"Background Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are commonly used as SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests both by medical professionals and laypeople. However, the performance of RADT in vaccinated individuals has not been fully investigated. Objectives RT-qPCR and rapid antigen detection testing were performed to evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. Study design Two swab specimens, one for RT-qPCR and one for RADT, were collected from vaccinated individuals in an outpatient clinic. For comparison of RADT performance in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, a dataset already published by this group was used as reference. Results A total of 696 samples were tested with both RT-qPCR and RADT that included 692 (99.4%) samples from vaccinated individuals. Of these, 76 (11.0%) samples were detected SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-qPCR and 45 (6.5%) samples by the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test. Stratified by Ct values, sensitivity of the RADT was 100.0%, 94.4% and 81.1% for Ct ≤ 20 (n=18), Ct ≤ 25 (n=36) and Ct ≤ 30 (n=53), respectively. Samples with Ct values ≥ 30 (n=23) were not detected. Overall RADT specificity was 99.7% and symptom status did not affect RADT performance. Notably, RADT detected 4 out of 4 samples of probable Omicron variant infection based on single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Conclusion Our results show that RADT testing remains a valuable tool in detecting breakthrough infections with high viral RNA loads.",2022,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,"Poopalasingam, Nareshkumar Korenkov Michael Ashurov Artem Strobel Janina Fish Irina Hellmich Martin Gruell Henning Lehmann Clara Heger Eva Klein Florian"
Comparison of Virtual Simulation to Clinical Practice for Prelicensure Nursing Students in Pediatrics,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic has required a transition from in-person clinical practice to virtual learning.

Exploring the development and maintenance of therapeutic relationships through e-Health support: A narrative analysis of therapist experiences,"Objective: Amid COVID-19 disruptions, e-therapy has become even more essential and has rapidly expanded across statutory, private and third sectors to meet growing demands for digital mental health support. A challenge in digital therapeutic care is how to develop and maintain a supportive, collaborative therapeutic relationship, built upon mutual trust and respect;intrinsic values of relationships that are often implied through complex non-verbal cues. Online practitioners are eager to learn how to adapt to online delivery, although platform-specific training is limited. The aim of the current study was to focus upon the therapist experience of online therapeutic relationships with young people, exploring a range of factors through their perspectives, including the impact of anonymity. Methods: Eight e-therapy practitioners were recruited from Kooth, an online mental health service. Narrative interviews undertaken via Skype facilitated reflective conversational one-to-one discussions, based upon the practitioners’ individual experiences, led by the interviewee. Following transcription and anonymisation, a narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participants’ experiences, perspectives and reflections. Results: Four analytic layers arose from the narratives, which explored the challenging learning experience of translating existing therapeutic skills to online working, rapidly building therapeutic relationships, managing risk in the online therapeutic relationship, and techniques for maintaining a digital therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into the flexibility and adjustments therapists can make to improve online interventions and delivery through the development and maintenance of positive therapeutic relationships.

The influence of classroom seating arrangement on children’s cognitive processes in primary school: The role of individual variables,"To date, despite the great debate regarding the best seating arrangement for learning in classrooms, no empirical studies have examined the direct effects of different seating arrangements on children’s cognitive processes. This is particularly important nowadays that the COVID-19 measures include maintaining distance in the classroom. Aim of this study was experimentally investigating the effect of changing the seating arrangement (clusters vs. rows and columns), on logical reasoning, creativity and theory of mind, in children attending primary school. Furthermore, some individual characteristics (e.g., gender, loneliness, popularity) were analysed as potential moderators. Results on 77 participants showed that, when children were seated in rows and columns, their score in logical reasoning was globally higher.

Identifying researcher learning needs to develop online training for UK researchers working with administrative data: CENTRIC training,"BACKGROUND: The use of administrative data in health and social science research continues to expand, with increased availability of data and interest from funders. Researchers, however, continue to experience delays in access, storage and sharing of administrative data. Training opportunities are limited and typically specific to individual data providers or focussed on the analytical aspects of working with administrative data. The CENTRIC study was funded by the Information Commissioners Office, with the aim of developing a broader training curriculum for researchers working with administrative data in the UK. METHODS: A mixed-methods design informed curriculum content, including surveys with researchers, focus group discussions with data providers and workshops with members of the public. Researchers were identified from relevant administrative data networks and invited to participate in an online survey identifying training needs. Data providers were approached with a request to input to a face-to-face or online meeting with two members of the research team about their experiences of working with researchers. Data were analysed within the broad framework of the interview schedule, free text responses in the survey were analysed thematically. RESULTS: 107 researchers responded to the online survey and four data providers participated in the focus groups. We identified five main themes, relating to research training needs for UK researchers working with administrative data: communication; timelines; changes & amendments; future-proofing applications; and, the availability of training and support. Data providers either provided additional evidence on these learning needs or ways to address identified challenges. Six modules were developed addressing these training needs. Quotes from the survey and focus groups are used anonymously in the online training modules. CONCLUSION: The CENTRIC online training curriculum was launched in September 2020 and is available, free of charge for UK researchers. CENTRIC specifically addresses commonly identified training needs of researchers working with administrative data.",2022-02-02,,"Lugg-Widger, Fiona; Munnery, Kim; Townson, Julia; Trubey, Rob; Robling, Michael"
"Secondary attack rate of COVID-19 in household contacts in the Winnipeg Health Region, Canada","OBJECTIVES: Understanding important transmission parameters, such as secondary attack rates, can help in strategizing, prioritizing, and planning interventions to curb morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Early reports suggest the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen that causes COVID-19 disease) is high among household contacts of cases. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in residents of the Winnipeg Health Region. METHODS: We extracted information on COVID-19 cases and their household contacts from the regional public health surveillance database and used this dataset to calculate secondary attack rates. RESULTS: We included 381 individuals from 102 unique households (102 primary cases and 279 household contacts). A total of 41 contacts from 25 households became secondary cases in the 14 days since last unprotected exposure to the primary case, resulting in a secondary attack rate of 14.7% (95% CI: 10.5-18.8). CONCLUSION: Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been an important contributor to the local COVID-19 epidemic.",2020,Can. j. public health,"Wilkinson, Krista; Chen, Xuan; Shaw, Souradet"

Learning from 2020: How the Challenges of Remote Teaching Reinforce the Need for Care-Informed Pedagogy,"How did instructors design their sociology courses for remote teaching during the 2020?2021 academic year, and what challenges did they face in teaching those courses? To answer these questions, we surveyed lead instructors and graduate teaching assistants (n?=?77) in the Sociology Department at the University of Michigan, supplemented by interviews with students and our experiences as remote course consultants. Through this case study, we found that instructors cited increased workload and lack of connection as challenges with remote teaching, in addition to pandemic-related struggles. Most instructors reported using either synchronous or a mix of synchronous and asynchronous instruction in course design, incorporating both formative and summative assessments, and implementing communication and community-building strategies to establish connections with and among students. We argue that these challenges and course designs highlight the importance of care-informed pedagogy to not only remote teaching in 2020?2021 but also sociology instruction in general.",2021,Teaching Sociology,"Hess, Kimberly McAuliffe Erin L.; Gleckman-Krut, Miriam Shapiro Shoshana"

Postdischarge rheumatic and musculoskeletal symptoms following hospitalization for COVID-19: prospective follow-up by phone interviews,"To describe the rheumatic and musculoskeletal symptoms at hospitalization as well as their persistence/severity after discharge with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify whether age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and length of hospital stay are associated with persistence of these symptoms. In this single-center cohort study, comprising 300 participants, two phone interviews were conducted (2-week and 1-month after hospitalization) and symptoms were queried with a standardized form. This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. The musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue (44.3% of patients reported), back pain (22.7%), arthralgia (22.0%), myalgia (21.0%), low back pain (16.3%), and neck pain (10.3%); the other symptoms were shortness of breath (26.3%), loss of taste (15.0%), cough (14.0%), loss of smell (12.3%), loss of appetite (10.3%), headache (8.7%), sore throat (3.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), dizziness (1.3%), and fever (0.3%) at 1-month. Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month. Nearly three-quarters reported one or more symptoms, with more than half of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at 1 month. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue, followed by back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and neck pain. The persistence of fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia was related to BMI. The study results increase our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient and better care for COVID-19 survivors.

Exploring the association of androgen modulation therapy among men hospitalized with covid19: A retrospective observational study,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: While primarily associated with prostate cancer pathogenesis, TMPRSS2 has recently been identified as a co-receptor for ACE2, the target protein used by SARSCoV2 for viral entry. This protein is primarily regulated by the androgen receptor, and this mechanism may partly explain the disproportionate burden of disease among males. We hypothesized that the use of androgen modulation therapies (AMT) such as 5-a-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may affect inpatient outcomes among hospitalized men with COVID-19. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis in a large urban hospital system, hospitalized males with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostate cancer was identified from February to June 2020. Men were then stratified by use of specific AMT (ADT or 5- ARI). Baseline patient and hospital characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and multivariable regression models were used to explore the association of AMT with inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and other ICU outcomes (ICU admission, ICU Length of Stay, Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Intubation, and ARDS). RESULTS: A total of 396 inpatients were identified, with 130 (32.8%) having prior use of AMT. Of these, a large majority used 5-ARI (n=122, 93.8%). Mean (SD) age of patients was higher for those using AMT (76.5 (10.7) vs. 71.1 (11.8) years;p<0.001). No significant differences were identified in AMT use by race, body mass index, smoking status, or Charlson Comorbidity Index. Despite adjustment for these factors, AMT use was not associated with ICU admission, ventilation status, length of ICU stay, or length of hospital stay. However, a non-significant trend of decreased mortality was identified with the use of AMT (adjusted OR: 0.56;95% CI: 0.29e1.02;p=0.06) (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analysis suggests that AMT does not appear to improve inpatient outcomes among hospitalized males with COVID-19. The non-significant trend of decreased inpatient mortality, however, may be attributed to insufficient power. Future research with large sample sizes may uncover potential benefits of androgen modulation on COVID19 pathogenesis and outcomes.",2021,Journal of Urology,"Ha, A.; Punjani, N.; Wang, V.; Caputo, J.; Wallace, B.

COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and escalation of patient care: a retrospective longitudinal cohort study,"BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome, which might contribute to morbidity and mortality. This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 μg/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 2·24 [95% CI 1·62–2·87]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. INTERPRETATION: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype. COV-HI might be useful to stratify patient groups in trial design.

[Effectiveness of the implementation of clinical-epidemiological management during Covid-19 in a medium-long-stay hospital.],"OBJECTIVE The effects of the Covid-19 health emergency have demonstrated the high vulnerability of people residing in medium and long-stay centers, with high mortality rates. Little data is available about contingency protocols to minimize the spread of the virus in these centers. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the preventive and management measures adopted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) to minimize the risk of transmission of Covid-19. METHODS A team of specialists in Preventive and Internal Medicine established a protocol for active surveillance, identification of suspected and confirmed cases, and follow-up of contacts. Also, a Unit for the care of confirmed cases was created with personnel specifically trained in Covid-19, to achieve better patient care and optimize the available resources. Descriptive statistical measures have been used to analyze the data. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 was 12.2%, with a cumulative incidence of 8.2%. After the protocol was established, control of the disease was achieved without hospital transmission after its application. Due to the alarm generated at the start of the pandemic, up to 45% of the requested RT-PCRs did not meet the criteria of the Ministry of Health, all of which were negative. The clinical characteristics of our patients differed slightly from those observed in other studies published in the general population, with cough and asthenia being the most frequent symptoms, present in 69.2% and 38.5%, respectively. 100% of the infected patients did not present complications that required assistance in the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS With the application of preventive and organizational actions, we consider that we have presented a low incidence of those infected. The preparation of protocols and their supervision is essential for the rapid identification of cases and optimization of the tests requested. Despite being a medium and long-stay hospital, we have not presented any mortality or complications that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit.",2020-07-13,Revista espanola de salud publica,"Ruiz Moruno, Antonio José; Rodríguez Cola, Miguel; Jiménez Velasco, Irena; Ruíz Delgado, Rosa María; González Rubio, Alicia"
The cultural differences in the effects of carbon emissions — an EKC analysis,The postmodernism stance critiques the current discourse of modern consumption–based societies. These societies legitimize their embedded beliefs and actions based on their lifestyle reflected through their consumption patterns. Their consumption patterns relate to carbon footprints that are yet to be explored in the current body of knowledge at the macro level. The legitimacy of their lifestyle and consumption patterns rely on their conscious efforts in reducing carbon footprints. This study uses the environmental Kuznets curve model and explores the impact of household lifestyle and household consumption patterns on CO(2) emissions across different cultures and societies worldwide. 49 countries were taken to assess how different cultures define consumption patterns related to CO(2) emission. The results showed that the curvilinear relationship between consumption and CO(2) depends on the country’s national cultural orientation.,2022-04-23,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Arshed, Noman; Hameed, Kamran; Saher, Asma; Yazdani, Naveed"
New-onset anosmia and ageusia in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in adult patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational analysis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital or managed in the community and their household contacts across a London population during the period March 1st to April 1st, 2020. Symptomatology and duration were extracted from routinely collected clinical data and follow-up telephone consultations. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 141 (92 community patients, 49 discharged inpatients) were included for analysis; 77/141 (55%) reported anosmia and ageusia, nine reported only ageusia and three only anosmia. The median onset of anosmia in relation to onset of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) symptoms (as defined by the Public Health England case definition) was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5). Median duration of anosmia was 8 days (IQR 16). Median duration of COVID-19 symptoms in community patients was 10 days (IQR 8) versus 18 days (IQR 13.5) in admitted patients. As of April 1, 45 patients had ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and/or anosmia; 107/141 (76%) patients had household contacts, and of 185 non-tested household contacts 79 (43%) had COVID-19 symptoms with 46/79 (58%) reporting anosmia. Six household contacts had anosmia only. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of the positive patients reported anosmia and ageusia, suggesting that these should be added to the case definition and used to guide self-isolation protocols. This adaptation may be integral to case findings in the absence of population-level testing. Until we have successful population-level vaccination coverage, these steps remain critical in the current and future waves of this pandemic.",2020,Clin. microbiol. infect,"Patel, A; Charani, E; Ariyanayagam, D; Abdulaal, A; Denny, S J; Mughal, N; Moore, L S P"
Face masks in the general healthy population. Scientific and ethical issues,"In most European countries, facemasks use is recommended or mandatory in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is not possible. In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence. What we need are recommendations explaining where, when, how and what type of mask to wear.",2020,"Gac. sanit.

Decolonizing drug policy,"This paper reviews evidence of how drug control has been used to uphold colonial power structures in select countries. It demonstrates the racist and xenophobic impact of drug control policy and proposes a path to move beyond oppressive systems and structures. The ‘colonization of drug control’ refers to the use of drug control by states in Europe and America to advance and sustain the systematic exploitation of people, land and resources and the racialized hierarchies, which were established under colonial control and continue to dominate today. Globally, Black, Brown and Indigenous peoples are disproportionately targeted for drug law enforcement and face discrimination across the criminal system. These communities face higher arrest, prosecution and incarceration rates for drug offenses than other communities, such as majority populations, despite similar rates of drug use and selling among (and between) different races. Current drug policies have contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths, overdoses and sustained transnational criminal enterprises at the expense of the lives of people who use drugs, their families and greater society. This review provides further evidence of the need to reform the current system. It outlines a three-pillared approach to rebuilding drug policy in a way that supports health, dignity and human rights, consisting of: (1) the decriminalization of drugs and their use; (2) an end to the mass incarceration of people who use drugs; (3) the redirection of funding away from ineffective and punitive drug control and toward health and social programs.",2021-11-27,Harm Reduct J,"Daniels, Colleen; Aluso, Aggrey; Burke-Shyne, Naomi; Koram, Kojo; Rajagopalan, Suchitra; Robinson, Imani; Shelly, Shaun; Shirley-Beavan, Sam; Tandon, Tripti"

Conception Preferences during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns,"Background: The COVID-19 lockdowns imposed new challenges to couples who were planning to conceive. In this research paper, we aimed to study the perceptions of women in Jordan during the pandemic regarding fertility behavior, the desire to use assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the awareness and beliefs of potential risks related to conception. Methods: A validated online-based questionnaire was distributed to women from April–May 2020, Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS version 22 and R software (2020); p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The total number of participants was 814 women, with 78.2% of the participants (58.7% fertile and 76.6% infertile) believing that pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic could be risky. Among them, 16% and 40%, respectively, were trying to conceive during the pandemic, and 97.4% and 89.9%, respectively, were not willing to use ART if needed during the pandemic. Young, nulliparous women who were married for less than one year were significantly associated with the desire to conceive during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This study concluded that the fertility behavior of women in Jordan changed during the pandemic, and their desire for natural conception and for using ART declined, as they believed that there were potential risks related to conceiving during the pandemic. However, the effect was greater among the general fertile population than the infertile.",2022-05-13,Behav Sci (Basel),"Albeitawi, Soha; Al-Alami, Zina; Khamaiseh, Khaldoun; Al Mehaisen, Lama; Khamees, Almu’atasim; Hamadneh, Jehan"

The Effect of Breathing Exercise Using Bubble Blower on Anxiety and Pain during Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block in Children Aged 7 to 10 Years: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of breathing exercise using bubble blower on anxiety and pain during inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) in children aged 7 to 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized crossover clinical trial, thirty-five children with moderate to severe anxiety requiring bilateral pulp therapy of mandibular primary molars were enrolled. Based on random lists, 18 children received the BE + IANB and 17 children received a routine IANB at the first session. This trend became reverse at the second visit for each child. Anxiety was measured using Facial Image Scale (FIS), blood pressure, and pulse rate. Face Leg Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale and Wong–Baker Facial Pain Scale (WBFPS) were used for pain measurement. The Paired Samples Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and Interclass Correlation Coefficient were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The means of FLACC, WBFPS, FIS, blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher at the control visit. However, these differences were statistically significant only for FLACC scale and WBFPS (P value <0.05). In subgroup analysis, only girls and children without any previous dental treatment showed significant differences in FLACC scale and WBFPS between the control and bubble blower side (P value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Breathing exercise using a bubble blower may be an efficient distraction and relaxation method to decrease pain of 7- to 10-year-old children with moderate to severe anxiety during inferior alveolar nerve block. However, anxiety levels were lower when applying BE, and the differences were not statistically significant.",2022-01-17,Pain Res Manag,"Bahrololoomi, Zahra; Sadeghiyeh, Tahereh; Rezaei, Maedeh; Maghsoudi, Nahid"
Coalescent inference for infectious disease: meta-analysis of hepatitis C,"Genetic analysis of pathogen genomes is a powerful approach to investigating the population dynamics and epidemic history of infectious diseases. However, the theoretical underpinnings of the most widely used, coalescent methods have been questioned, casting doubt on their interpretation. The aim of this study is to develop robust population genetic inference for compartmental models in epidemiology. Using a general approach based on the theory of metapopulations, we derive coalescent models under susceptible–infectious (SI), susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) dynamics. We show that exponential and logistic growth models are equivalent to SI and SIS models, respectively, when co-infection is negligible. Implementing SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST, we conduct a meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics, and show that we can directly estimate the basic reproductive number (R(0)) and prevalence under SIR dynamics. We find that differences in genetic diversity between epidemics can be explained by differences in underlying epidemiology (age of the epidemic and local population density) and viral subtype. Model comparison reveals SIR dynamics in three globally restricted epidemics, but most are better fit by the simpler SI dynamics. In summary, metapopulation models provide a general and practical framework for integrating epidemiology and population genetics for the purposes of joint inference.",2013-03-19,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Dearlove, Bethany; Wilson, Daniel J."
Intensive support recommendations for critically-ill patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection,"ABSTRACT In December 2019, a series of patients with severe pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, who progressed to severe acute respiratory syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome Subsequently, COVID-19 was attributed to a new betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Approximately 20% of patients diagnosed as COVID-19 develop severe forms of the disease, including acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, severe acute respiratory syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure and require intensive care There is no randomized controlled clinical trial addressing potential therapies for patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the time of publishing these treatment recommendations Therefore, these recommendations are based predominantly on the opinion of experts (level C of recommendation) RESUMO Em dezembro de 2019, uma série de pacientes com pneumonia grave foi identificada em Wuhan, província de Hubei, na China Esses pacientes evoluíram para síndrome respiratória aguda grave e síndrome do desconforto respiratório agudo Posteriormente, a COVID-19 foi atribuída a um novo betacoronavírus, o coronavírus da síndrome respiratória aguda grave 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Cerca de 20% dos pacientes com diagnóstico de COVID-19 desenvolvem formas graves da doença, incluindo insuficiência respiratória aguda hipoxêmica, síndrome respiratória aguda grave, síndrome do desconforto respiratório agudo e insuficiência renal aguda e requerem admissão em unidade de terapia intensiva Não há nenhum ensaio clínico randomizado controlado que avalie potenciais tratamentos para pacientes com infecção confirmada pela COVID-19 no momento da publicação destas recomendações de tratamento Dessa forma, essas recomendações são baseadas predominantemente na opinião de especialistas (grau de recomendação de nível C)",2020,Einstein (Säo Paulo),"Corrêa, Thiago Domingos Matos Gustavo Faissol Janot de Bravim Bruno de Arruda Cordioli Ricardo Luiz Garrido Alejandra del Pilar Gallardo Assuncao Murillo Santucci Cesar de Barbas Carmen Silvia Valente Timenetsky Karina Tavares Rodrigues Roseny dos Reis Guimarães Hélio Penna Rabello Filho Roberto Lomar Frederico Polito Scarin Farah Christina de La Cruz Batista Carla Luciana Pereira Adriano José Guerra João Carlos de Campos Carneiro Bárbara Vieira Nawa Ricardo Kenji Brandão Rodrigo Martins Pesaro Antônio Eduardo Pereira Silva Júnior Moacyr Carvalho Fabricio Rodrigues Torres de Silva Cilene Saghabi de Medeiros Almeida Ana Claudia Ferraz de Franken Marcelo Pesavento Marcele Liliane Eid Raquel Afonso Caserta Ferraz Leonardo José Rolim"

Does pandemic justify the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prevention of COVID‐19 in India?,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic against COVID‐19 among health care workers and asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID. This is widely criticised as a hastily taken step with political inclination and minimal evidence backing. In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID‐19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses. This has important public health implications which are discussed below. Better communication should have been planned to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. However, as a nation of 1.3 billion, we need to capitalize on this opportunity to generate data and valuable evidence on the use of HCQ to beat this pandemic. All health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial/observational study and get registered online to generate useful data related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 patients are under surveillance by the state and local health authorities and could also be roped into this study to generate robust evidence. Of course, pandemic does not just justify the use of HCQ, but pandemic is the time to innovate, think out of box and generate evidence to prove the same so that we can lives.

BRD4 Prevents R-Loop Formation and Transcription-Replication Conflicts by Ensuring Efficient Transcription Elongation,"Effective spatio-temporal control of transcription and replication during S-phase is paramount to maintaining genomic integrity and cell survival. Dysregulation of these systems can lead to conflicts between the transcription and replication machinery, causing DNA damage and cell death. BRD4 allows efficient transcriptional elongation by stimulating phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We report that bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein loss of function (LOF) causes RNAPII pausing on the chromatin and DNA damage affecting cells in S-phase. This persistent RNAPII-dependent pausing leads to an accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) at sites of BRD4 occupancy, leading to transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), DNA damage, and cell death. Finally, our data show that the BRD4 C-terminal domain, which interacts with P-TEFb, is required to prevent R-loop formation and DNA damage caused by BET protein LOF.",2020-09-22,Cell Rep,"Edwards, Drake S.; Maganti, Rohin; Tanksley, Jarred P.; Luo, Jie; Park, James J.H.; Balkanska-Sinclair, Elena; Ling, Jinjie; Floyd, Scott R."

Convalescent plasma in COVID-19: Does use case matter?,"A randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma in severe COVID-19 shows no benefits Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of individuals worldwide One of the most severe manifestations of COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure and the need for intensive care Endeavoring to improve morbidity and mortality has been key, and several interventions have been attempted to modify outcomes in this critically ill population One of these interventions is convalescent plasma: plasma collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and have high titers of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent plasma has been postulated to confer protection and improve outcomes Based on the results from several non-randomized and observational studies, convalescent plasma is currently being used for the treatment of COVID-19, especially in critically ill patients However, Simonovich et al published the results of a randomized controlled trial in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia that questions this treatment In the study, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to receive convalescent plasma or placebo in addition to standard care to assess impact on a six-point ordinal clinical status scale ranging from total recovery to death, 30 days after the intervention Overall, 228 patients were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo in a 2:1 ratio At 30 days, no significant difference was found between convalescent plasma and placebo for any clinical outcome, including mortality Although this trial has some limitations, including a limited sample size and lower antibody titers than in the observational studies, the results call into question the widespread clinical practice of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia Does this mean that convalescent plasma has no utility? COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease, and the manifestations and pathophysiology differ depending on the stage of disease A non-peer reviewed preprint has shown that when infected individuals were randomized to early administration of high-titer convalescent plasma, COVID-19 progression was reduced However, randomized controlled trials are ideally needed before any intervention becomes standard of care, and COVID-19 should be no exception © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science All rights reserved AAAS is a partner of HINARI, AGORA, OARE, CHORUS, CLOCKSS, CrossRef and COUNTER",2020,Science Translational Medicine,"Nadkarni, G.

The impact of COVID-19 on the labour market for persons affected by Hansen's disease,"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, affecting the econ-omy of many societies, increasing poverty and inequalities. The lockdown measures heavily affected vulnerable social groups, including persons affected by Hansen’s disease (PaHd) and their families. Stigma, late diagnosis and related disability make PaHd a population in a situation of vulnerability. Poor sanitary and socio-economic conditions, lower levels of education and food insecurity are risk markers for Hansen’s disease. Before COVID-19, PaHd were refused employment or lost their jobs due to physical impairment or discrimination. Job losses worldwide are hitting hardest on poor and vulnerable populations, therefore pushing millions of people to extreme poverty. Hansen’s disease, also known as leprosy, is only endemic in the poorest areas of the world. Although specific data regarding PaHd are scarce, we traced a parallel between the impact of the current pandemic on the labour market on various excluded and marginalized populations, such as persons with disabilities and PaHd. Our objective was to understand the current scenario and also to gather strategies and good practices to guarantee and promote the right to work as an instrument of inclusion and social advancement, to break the cycle of poverty for PaHd. © The author(s).",2021,Leprosy Review,"Corrêa de Sousa, Ana Carolina"
Telework in a pandemic context: protocol of a participatory study on the effects of teleworking conditions on the well-being and social participation of workers,"INTRODUCTION: Although several authors have been interested in the well-being and social participation of teleworkers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that most of the recommendations issued are based on literature reviews or expert opinions; yet few authors have documented the perspectives of the workers. The aim of this study is to explore workers’ perspectives of teleworking in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the effects on their well-being and social participation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a participatory study protocol involving the collaboration of a community organisation defending workers’ rights, the first step will be to conduct focus groups to qualitatively describe workers’ perspectives of their teleworking conditions. Then, an online questionnaire will be administered to a large pool or workers to quantitatively explore the influence of individual, organisational and environmental variables on the well-being and social participation of workers. The thematic and statistical analyses of the data collected will indicate successful practices to be adopted by workers and organisations. These successful practices will be validated by workers through a Technique for Research of Information by Animation of a Group of Experts group and will serve as concrete tools to better support workers’ participation in teleworking. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of the research ethics board of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de la Capitale Nationale has been obtained. Findings will be shared with various stakeholders including workers, employers, insurers and unions. Findings will be disseminated in webinars, peer-reviewed journals and lectures.",2021-08-24,BMJ Open,"Lecours, Alexandra; Gilbert, Marie-Hélène; Lord, Marie-Michèle; Labrecque, Charlotte; Boucher, Frédéric"
COVID-19 Disruption Strategy for Redesigning Global Supply Chain Network across TPP Countries,"Background: COVID-19 has disrupted and adversely affected supply chains worldwide. A global supply chain network that considers disruptions is needed. This study strategically analyzes the economic and structural effects of disruption on a global supply chain network with customs duty and the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) agreement. Methods: We present a cost minimization model which helps in understanding the difficulty of supplying materials or products to factories or customers if the supplier’s cities are facing disruption. This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation. The sensitivity analysis for customs duty shows that the TPP has a positive impact on cost maintained, even in the presence of disruptions. Conclusions: Suppliers should be switched depending on the scale of disruption;when many distant suppliers need to be switched, the factory should be relocated to the country where these suppliers are located.",2022,Logistics,"Nagao, Takaki Ijuin Hiromasa Yamada Tetsuo Nagasawa Keisuke Zhou Lei"
Distinct cellular immune signatures in acute Zika virus infection are associated with high or low persisting neutralizing antibody titers,"Although the formation of a durable neutralizing antibody response after an acute viral infection is a key component of protective immunity, little is known about why some individuals generate high versus low neutralizing antibody titers to infection or vaccination. Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy can cause devastating fetal outcomes, and efforts to understand natural immunity to this infection are essential for optimizing vaccine design. In this study, we leveraged the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to deeply characterize the cellular immune response to acute and convalescent ZIKV infection in a cohort of blood donors in Puerto Rico incidentally found to be viremic during the 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas. During acute ZIKV infection, we identified widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptive immune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated innate immune subsets, as well as activated follicular helper CD4+ T cells and proliferating CD27-IgD-B cells, during acute infection were associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies at 6 months post-infection. On the other hand, low titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were associated with immune features that suggested a cytotoxic-skewed immune “set-point.” Our study offers insight into the cellular coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkers that may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials for ZIKV and other acute viral infections aimed at inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

"Avoiding high ozone pollution in Delhi, India.","Surface ozone is a major pollutant threatening public health, agricultural production and natural ecosystems. While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.",2020-11-27,Faraday discussions,"Chen, Ying; Beig, Gufran; Archer-Nicholls, Scott; Drysdale, Will; Acton, W Joe F; Lowe, Douglas; Nelson, Beth; Lee, James; Ran, Liang; Wang, Yu; Wu, Zhijun; Sahu, Saroj Kumar; Sokhi, Ranjeet S; Singh, Vikas; Gadi, Ranu; Nicholas Hewitt, C; Nemitz, Eiko; Archibald, Alex; McFiggans, Gordon; Wild, Oliver"
"COVID‐19 and Mental Health of Young Adult Children in China: Economic Impact, Family Dynamics, and Resilience","OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine the economic impact of COVID‐19 virus on family dynamics and college‐age children's mental health in China and to identity personal and social or relational resilience factors that could buffer the negative consequences of COVID‐19. BACKGROUND: Since an outbreak of COVID‐19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college‐age young adult children. METHOD: Using a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parent–child interactions, and individual well‐being during COVID‐19. RESULTS: Results from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID‐19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self‐control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parent–child interactions. CONCLUSION: Findings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID‐19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts. IMPLICATIONS: Implications to family researchers, family life educators, practitioners, and policymakers were discussed.",2021-07-19,Fam Relat,"Cui, Ming; Hong, Peipei"
The Diagnostic Value of High-Resolution Computed Tomography Features Combined with Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Ribonucleic Acid Load Detection for Refractory Mycoplasma Pneumonia,"The aim of this study was to investigate the value of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images and mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) ribonucleic acid (RNA) load detection in the early diagnosis of refractory mycoplasma pneumoniae (RMP) and provide more methods for the diagnosis and treatment of RMP. Seventy children with MP were divided into the RMP group (H1 group, 31 cases) and the MP group (H2 group, 39 cases) according to pathological findings, and all of them underwent CT scanning. MP-RNA load and genotype distribution were analyzed in both groups, and the diagnostic efficacy of CT combined with MP-RNA load for RMP was calculated. The sensitivity of children in the H1 group to erythromycin (59.17% vs 71.56%) and clarithromycin (53.21% vs 67.03%) was lower than that in the H2 group, and the resistance rate of children in the H1 group to erythromycin (71.43% vs 67.53%) and clarithromycin (64.24% vs 50.37%) was higher than that in the H2 group (P < 0.05); the regression coefficients between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the MPLI value of RMP were −0.064 and −0.413, respectively, which were significantly negatively correlated (P < 0.05); the accuracy (96.5%), sensitivity (92.5%), and specificity (88%) of CT + MP-RNA in the diagnosis of RMP were significantly higher than those of CT alone (91%, 88%, and 82%) and MP-RNA alone (88%, 84.5%, and 74%), which were significantly different (P < 0.05). The results of high MP-RNA load detection can be used as an indicator to predict RMP, and the diagnostic efficacy is significantly improved after combination with high-resolution CT, with high clinical application value.",2022-05-04,Contrast Media Mol Imaging,"Wei, Hongping; Wang, Chunyan; Ding, Lili; Wu, Min"
"Pharmacotherapy to delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: past, present and future","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with diabetes, and is one of the most important causes of end stage renal disease worldwide. In order to reduce progression of DKD, important management goals include treatment of hypertension, glycaemia and control of cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids, diet, smoking and exercise. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has an established role in prevention of progression of DKD. A number of other agents such as endothelin-1 receptor antagonists and bardoxolone have had disappointing results. Recent studies have, however, suggested that newer antidiabetic agents such as sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues have specific beneficial effects in patients with DKD. Indeed most recent guidance suggest that SGLT-2i drugs should be used early in DKD, irrespective of glucose control. A number of pathways are hypothesised for the development and progression of DKD, and have opened up a number of newer potential therapeutic targets. This article aims to discuss management of DKD with respect to seminal trials from the past, more recent trials informing the present and potential new therapeutic options that may be available in the future.",2022-03-04,Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab,"Mallik, Ritwika; Chowdhury, Tahseen A."

Increasing Cybercrime Since the Pandemic: Concerns for Psychiatry,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the pandemic, the daily activities of many people occur at home. People connect to the Internet for work, school, shopping, entertainment, and doctor visits, including psychiatrists. Concurrently, cybercrime has surged worldwide. This narrative review examines the changing use of technology, societal impacts of the pandemic, how cybercrime is evolving, individual vulnerabilities to cybercrime, and special concerns for those with mental illness. RECENT FINDINGS: Human factors are a central component of cybersecurity as individual behaviors, personality traits, online activities, and attitudes to technology impact vulnerability. Mental illness may increase vulnerability to cybercrime. The risks of cybercrime should be recognized as victims experience long-term psychological and financial consequences. Patients with mental illness may not be aware of the dangers of cybercrime, of risky online behaviors, or the measures to mitigate risk. SUMMARY: Technology provides powerful tools for psychiatry but technology must be used with the appropriate safety measures. Psychiatrists should be aware of the potential aftermath of cybercrime on mental health, and the increased patient risk since the pandemic, including from online mental health services. As a first step to increase patient awareness of cybercrime, psychiatrists should provide a recommended list of trusted sources that educate consumers on cybersecurity.",2021-03-03,Curr Psychiatry Rep,"Monteith, Scott; Bauer, Michael; Alda, Martin; Geddes, John; Whybrow, Peter C; Glenn, Tasha"
The analgesic efficacy of subcostal transversus abdominis plane block with Mercedes incision.,"BACKGROUND Conventional perioperative analgesic modalities (e.g. opioids, epidural analgesia) have their own drawbacks, which limit their clinical application. This study investigated the opioid-sparing effectsof the oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) blockade with ropivacaine for the patients undergoing open liver resection with a Mercedes incision. METHODS 126 patients who were scheduled for open liver resection were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral ultrasound-guided OSTAPblocks with either 0.375% ropivacaine (groupT) or 0.9% isotonic saline (group C). Both groups also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and intravenous 40 mg parecoxib every 12 h for a total of 3 days. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded. RESULTS 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively). Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the incidence of nausea was reduced in group T. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with saline.

Students are placed with academic research mentors in various Schools and Departments across the IUPUI campus, and also with industry laboratories. o COVID-related restrictions required development of 100% virtual program. Key aspects of the virtual program included: cohort-based research mentor assignments with 1-4 mentees matched per research mentor, research projects that could be conducted virtually, heavy engagement of high-school teachers to facilitate the research experience with cohorts of mentees, a more rigorous virtual seminar series that included new modules such as COVID-specific programming and thus enhancing public education about COVID. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: o The program served 130 students in summer 2020. o We were able to recruit new faculty and industry mentors involved in data science research. As a result, we have now increased our mentor pool to serve more students in the future. o Because student participation was virtual, we were able to accept students from further distances (up to 120 miles away) across the state. We were also able to accept local economically disadvantaged students that may have not been able to participate because of lack of reliable transportation. o A positive unanticipated outcome was that mentees relationships with the mentors was established virtually thus increasing the potential for students to remain engaged in their research. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: o Adapting to a virtual platform provided research experience to high school students during a time when traditional approaches were not possible. Given some research experiences do not require in-person activities, this newly established model could be used moving forward to allow more statewide engagement in research experiences.",2021,Journal of clinical and translational science,"Sanders, Elmer Cruz Leigh-Ann Speidell Emily Schnabel Rose Balaji Adhitya Hogarth Elise Miller Jade Vaides Sofia Allen Matthew R."
Identifying pandemic-related stress factors from social-media posts -- effects on students and young-adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown natural life out of gear across the globe. Strict measures are deployed to curb the spread of the virus that is causing it, and the most effective of them have been social isolation. This has led to wide-spread gloom and depression across society but more so among the young and the elderly. There are currently more than 200 million college students in 186 countries worldwide, affected due to the pandemic. The mode of education has changed suddenly, with the rapid adaptation of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. This study presents insights gathered from social media posts that were posted by students and young adults during the COVID times. Using statistical and NLP techniques, we analyzed the behavioral issues reported by users themselves in their posts in depression-related communities on Reddit. We present methodologies to systematically analyze content using linguistic techniques to find out the stress-inducing factors. Online education, losing jobs, isolation from friends, and abusive families emerge as key stress factors.",2020-12-01,,"Thukral, Sachin; Sangwan, Suyash; Chatterjee, Arnab; Dey, Lipika"

Blood safety and the choice of anti‐hemophilic factor concentrate,"Hemophilia is a congenital disorder due to the deficiency of the activity of factor VIII (classical hemophilia A) or IX (Christmas disease or hemophilia B). Bleeding is common and may result in long‐term complications or even death. Bleeding may be treated or prevented by infusion of factor concentrates however these drugs are not without risk. Clinicians often feel ill prepared to provide accurate and impartial information regarding these drugs. This review will provide the reader with an historical yet up to date perspective on blood safety as it relates to the choice of concentrates to treat hemophilia.

Trans cohort metabolic reprogramming towards glutaminolysis in long-term successfully treated HIV-infection,"Despite successful combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), persistent low-grade immune activation together with inflammation and toxic antiretroviral drugs can lead to long-lasting metabolic flexibility and adaptation in people living with HIV (PLWH). Our study investigated alterations in the plasma metabolic profiles by comparing PLWH on long-term cART(>5 years) and matched HIV-negative controls (HC) in two cohorts from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), Cameroon, and India, respectively, to understand the system-level dysregulation in HIV-infection. Using untargeted and targeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling and applying advanced system biology methods, an altered amino acid metabolism, more specifically to glutaminolysis in PLWH than HC were reported. A significantly lower level of neurosteroids was observed in both cohorts and could potentiate neurological impairments in PLWH. Further, modulation of cellular glutaminolysis promoted increased cell death and latency reversal in pre-monocytic HIV-1 latent cell model U1, which may be essential for the clearance of the inducible reservoir in HIV-integrated cells.",2022-01-11,Commun Biol,"Mikaeloff, Flora; Svensson Akusjärvi, Sara; Ikomey, George Mondinde; Krishnan, Shuba; Sperk, Maike; Gupta, Soham; Magdaleno, Gustavo Daniel Vega; Escós, Alejandra; Lyonga, Emilia; Okomo, Marie Claire; Tagne, Claude Tayou; Babu, Hemalatha; Lorson, Christian L.; Végvári, Ákos; Banerjea, Akhil C.; Kele, Julianna; Hanna, Luke Elizabeth; Singh, Kamal; de Magalhães, João Pedro; Benfeitas, Rui; Neogi, Ujjwal"
The COVID‐19 Menace,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which binds to ectoenzyme angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2. It is very contagious and is spreading rapidly around the world. Until now, coronaviruses have mainly been associated with the aerodigestive tract due to the presence of a monobasic cleavage site for the resident transmembrane serine protease 2. Notably, SARS‐CoV‐2 is equipped with a second, polybasic cleavage site for the ubiquitous furin protease, which may determine the widespread tissue tropism. Furthermore, the terminal sequence of the furin‐cleaved spike protein also binds to neuropilin receptors. Clinically, there is enormous variability in the severity of the disease. Severe consequences are seen in a relatively small number of patients, most show moderate symptoms, but asymptomatic cases, especially among young people, drive disease spread. Unfortunately, the number of local infections can quickly build up, causing disease outbreaks suddenly exhausting health services’ capacity. Therefore, COVID‐19 is dangerous and unpredictable and has become the most serious threat for generations. Here, the latest research on COVID‐19 is summarized, including its spread, testing methods, organ‐specific complications, the role of comorbidities, long‐term consequences, mortality, as well as a new hope for immunity, drugs, and vaccines.",2021-05-07,Glob Chall,"Walczak, Piotr; Janowski, Miroslaw"
"Challenges, opportunities and progress in solid waste management during COVID-19 pandemic","At the end of December 2019, Wuhan City became the epicenter of the highly contagious virus known as the novel coronavirus. Now that mid-2020 has already passed, almost every country is adversely affected by Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The routine activities of people of all ages are overturned, which has led to a shift in the trends of waste created by households, streets, and most importantly, medical facilities and quarantine centers. Compulsive use of personal protection equipment such as masks, gloves, sanitizers, etcetera by the frontline workers from the medical sector, banks, daily need stores, waste collection industries, etc. and the use of masks by every common man stepping out has skewed the trend of waste generation to a different direction. Recently, the replacement of single-use plastic was accepted by the masses, and the pandemic suddenly rebounded to the previous situation, it is expected to be worse in the long run. Another secondary outcome is reduced waste collection and recycling due to lockdown, leading to a pile-up of wastes. But several nations are adopting strategies to break the transmission chain of the virus by trying to minimize human contact. The study discusses the effect of COVID-19 on the generation, recycling, and disposal of solid waste. A brief collection of different countries' efforts to restrict the transmission of virus through solid waste is also discussed.",2020-11-25,,"Tripathi, Abhilasha; Tyagi, Vinay Kumar; Vivekanand, Vivekanand; Bose, Purnendu; Suthar, Surinder"

Bacteremia during COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Spain Bacteriemia durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en un hospital terciario de España,"Introduction The reasons for the decrease in blood cultures were investigated and the rate and aetiology of bacteremia and contaminated blood cultures collected from COVID and non-COVID patients were assessed. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis in a tertiary hospital in Spain during the COVID period from 4th March 2020 to 21st June 2020. Results The number of blood cultures processed was 5313, representing 22.7% and 18.8% of decrease compared to the same months of 2019 and 2018, respectively (p = 0.173). The rate of bacteremia was 1.2% higher among COVID-patients than among non-COVID patients (p < 0.001). COVID patients had a higher proportion of nosocomial bacteremia (95.5%) than non-COVID patients (30.5%) (p < 0.001). In COVID-positive patients, the contamination rate was 12.3% vs 5.7% in non-COVID patients (p < 0.001). Conclusion There was a decrease in the number of blood cultures collected during the COVID period compared to previous years.

A coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance: phantom and animal experiments.,"PURPOSE To evaluate the accuracy of the robot-assisted computed tomography (CT)-guided coordinate positioning puncture method by phantom and animal experiments. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21° vs. 21.23° p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups. However, the number CT scans required (2.44 vs. 3.33, p = .002), and the radiation exposure dose (772.98 vs. 1077.89 mGy/cm, p = .003) were lower in the robot group than in the manual group. CONCLUSIONS The coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance can reach an accuracy that is comparable to that of the traditional manual CT-guided puncture method and with fewer CT scanning times accompanied with a lower radiation dosage.",2020-07-07,Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,"Zhang, Weifan; Xia, Peng; Liu, Shijie; Huang, Xiaowei; Zhao, Xinhui; Liu, Zhao; Dang, Hui; Li, Xiaohu; Niu, Gang"
COVID-19: Insight into the asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection and transmission,"The existence of a substantial but unclear number of asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients worldwide has raised concerns among global public health authorities. In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients.",2020-08-27,Int J Biol Sci,"Han, Dongsheng; Li, Rui; Han, Yanxi; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming"
Evaluation of the association of length of stay in hospital and outcomes,"BACKGROUND: There exist wide variations in healthcare quality within the National Health Service (NHS). A shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) has been implicated as premature discharge, that may in turn lead to adverse consequences. We tested the hypothesis that a short LOS might be associated with increased risk of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge and also post-discharge mortality. METHODS: We conducted a single-centred study of 32 270 (46.1% men) consecutive alive-discharge episodes (mean age = 64.0 years, standard deviation = 20.5, range = 18–107 years), collected between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019. Associations of LOS tertiles (middle tertile as a reference) with readmissions and mortality were assessed using observed/expected ratios, and logistic and Cox regressions to estimate odds (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) (adjusted for age, sex, patients’ severity of underlying health status and index admissions), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The observed numbers of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge or post-discharge mortality were lower than expected (observed: expected ratio < 1) in patients in the bottom tertile (<1.2 days) and middle tertile (1.2–4.3 days) of LOS, whilst higher than expected (observed: expected ratio > 1) in patients in the top tertile (>4.3 days), amongst all ages. Patients in the top tertile of LOS had increased risks for one readmission: OR = 2.32 (95% CI = 1.86–2.88) or ≥2 readmissions: OR = 6.17 (95% CI = 5.11–7.45), death within 30 days: OR = 2.87 (95% CI = 2.34–3.51), and within six months of discharge: OR = 2.52 (95% CI = 2.23–2.85), and death over a two-year period: HR = 2.25 (95% CI = 2.05–2.47). The LOS explained 7.4% and 15.9% of the total variance (r(2)) in one readmission and ≥2 readmissions, and 9.1% and 10.0% of the total variance in mortality with 30 days and within six months of hospital discharge, respectively. Within the bottom, middle and top tertiles of the initial LOS, the median duration from hospital discharge to death progressively shortened from 136, 126 to 80 days, whilst LOS during readmission lengthened from 0.4, 0.9 to 2.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short LOS in hospital was associated with favourable post-discharge outcomes such as early readmission and mortality, and with a delay in time interval from discharge to death and shorter LOS in hospital during readmission. These findings indicate that timely discharge from our hospital meets the aims of the NHS-generated national improvement programme, Getting It Right First Time.",2021-12-17,Int J Qual Health Care,"Han, Thang S; Murray, Paul; Robin, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Peter; Fluck, David; Fry, Christopher H"
Impaired Endothelial Function in Convalescent Phase of COVID-19: A 3 Month Follow Up Observational Prospective Study,"Background: Endothelial dysfunction has a role in acute COVID-19, contributing to systemic inflammatory syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and vascular events. Evidence regarding COVID-19 middle- and long-term consequences on endothelium are still lacking. Our study aimed to evaluate if COVID-19 severity could significantly affect the endothelial function after three months from the acute phase. Methods: We assessed endothelial function in outpatients with previous COVID-19 three months after negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients categorized according to a four-variable COVID-19 severity scale ('home care';;'hospital, no oxygen';;'hospital, oxygen';;'hospital requiring high-flow nasal canula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation';). FMD difference among COVID-19 severity categories was assessed with analysis of variance;we further clarified the relationship between FMD and previous COVID-19 severity with multivariate logistic models. Results: Among 658 consecutive COVID-19 subjects, we observed a significant linear trend of FMD reduction with the increase of the COVID-19 category (p < 0.0001). The presence of endothelial dysfunction was more frequent among hospitalized patients (78.3%) with respect to home-care patients (21.7%;p < 0.0001). COVID-19 severity was associated with increased endothelial dysfunction risk (OR: 1.354;95% CI: 1.06–1.71;p = 0.011) at multivariate binary logistic analysis. FMD showed a significant direct correlation with PaO2 (p = 0.004), P/F ratio (p = 0.004), FEV1 (p = 0.008), and 6MWT (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 subjects showed an impaired endothelial function three months after the acute phase that correlated with pulmonary function impairment.

"Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike trimeric ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: structural relationships with infectivity, evasion to immune system and transmissibility","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

Contemporary management and time to revascularization in upper extremity arterial injury,"INTRODUCTION: Upper extremity arterial injury is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for trauma patients, but there is a paucity of data to guide the clinician in the management of these injuries. The goals of this review were to characterize the demographics, presentation, clinical management, and outcomes, and to evaluate how time to intervention associates with outcomes in trauma patients with upper extremity vascular injuries. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) Research Data Set for the years 2007-2016 was queried in order to identify adult patients (age ≥ 18) with an upper extremity arterial injury. Patients with brachiocephalic, subclavian, axillary, or brachial artery injury using the 1998 and 2005 versions of the Abbreviated Injury Scale were included. Patients with non-survivable injuries to the brain, traumatic amputation, or other major arterial injuries to the torso or lower extremities were excluded. RESULTS: The data from 7908 patients with upper extremity arterial injuries was reviewed. Of those, 5407 (68.4%) underwent repair of the injured artery. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 10 (IQR = 7-18), and 7.7% of patients had a severe ISS (≥ 25). Median time to repair was 120 min (IQR = 60-240 min). Management was open repair in 52.3%, endovascular repair in 7.3%, and combined open and endovascular repairs in 8.8%; amputation occurred in 1.8% and non-operative management was used in 31.6% of patients. Blunt mechanism of injury, crush injury, concomitant fractures/dislocations, and nerve injuries were associated with amputation, whereas simultaneous venous injury was not. There was a significant decrease in the rate of amputation when patients undergoing surgical revascularization did so within 90 min of injury (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Injuries to arteries of the upper extremity are managed with open repair, endovascular repair, and, rarely, amputation. Expeditious transport to the operating room for revascularization is the key for limb salvage.",2022,Vascular,"Chipman, Amanda M; Ottochian, Marcus; Ricaurte, Daniel; Gunter, Grahya; DuBose, Joseph J; Stonko, David P; Feliciano, David V; Scalea, Thomas M; Morrison, Jonathan"

A Century of Political Influence: The Evolution of the Canadian Nurses Association's Policy Advocacy Agenda.,"The Canadian Nurses Association has a long-standing history of strengthening the nursing profession and the health system, supporting professional practice, and advocating for healthy public policy at the local, national, and global level. Historical writings have typically focused on the significant milestones achieved throughout the past century, and the various social, political, and economic contexts that have shaped the evolution of the association. While historical sources illustrate an organization with a strong track record of policy advocacy leadership and presence, there is little literature that has examined how the association's policy advocacy agenda has evolved overtime. Using Shamian's emerging ""Bubble"" Theory and Spheres of Policy Influence Model as an analytical framework, the authors use historical archives and documents to examine the internal and external drivers that have shaped the association's policy advocacy agenda over the past century and conclude that the Canadian Nurses Association has established itself as a credible leader in shaping not only nursing but also health-care and public policy at the local, national, and global level.",2020-09-01,The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,"Chiu, Patrick; Villeneuve, Michael J; Paul, Pauline"
Future-Proofing Geriatric Mental Health Care Services in India: Training and Policy Directions,"BACKGROUND: A burgeoning rise in the elderly subpopulation is being noted in India.

Identification of chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome of Semiothisa cinerearia,"Olfaction plays vital roles in the survival and reproduction of insects. The completion of olfactory recognition requires the participation of various complex protein families. However, little is known about the olfactory-related proteins in Semiothisa cinerearia Bremer et Grey, an important pest of Chinese scholar tree. In this study, we sequenced the antennal transcriptome of S. cinerearia and identified 125 olfactory-related genes, including 25 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), eight gustatory receptors (GRs) and 23 ionotropic receptors (IRs). BLASTX best hit results and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes were most identical to their respective orthologs from Ectropis obliqua.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and multiple sclerosis,"Background: Risk factors associated with the severity of COVID- 19 in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) begin to be identified from several cohort studies Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) may modify the risk of developing a severe COVID-19 infection, beside identified risk factors such as age and comorbidities Objectives: The objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 severity Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study (COVISEP registry, NCT04355611) included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 14, 2020 The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1: not hospitalized, no limitations on activities, to 7: death;cutoff at 3: hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen) We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics and outcome Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the influence of collected variables on COVID-19 outcome Results: A total of 405 patients (mean age: 44 7 years, female/male: 293/112, mean disease duration: 13 4 years) were analyzed Seventy-eight patients (19 3%) had a COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3, and 12 patients (3 0%) died from COVID-19 Median EDSS was 2 0 (range: 0-9 5), 326 patients (80 5%) were on DMT There was a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 among patients with no DMT relative to patients on DMTs (39 2% versus 14 4%, p&lt;0 001) Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (OR for 10 years: 1 8, 95% CI: 1 4-2 4), EDSS (OR for EDSS ≥ 6: 4 5, 95% CI: 2 0-10 0) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 (hospitalization or higher severity) while immunomodulatory treatment (interferon or glatiramer acetate) was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 (OR: 0 2, 95% CI: 0 05-0 8) EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2= 0 18), followed by age (R2= 0 06) and immunomodulatory treatment (R2= 0 02) Conclusions: EDSS and age were independent risk factors of severe COVID-19, while exposure to immunomodulatory DMTs (interferon and glatiramer acetate) were independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity We did not find an association between other DMTs exposure (including immunosuppressive therapies) and COVID-19 severity The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of MS patients during the COVID- 19 pandemic",2020,Multiple Sclerosis Journal,"Louapre, C.; Collongues, N.; Stankoff, B.; Giannesini, C.; Papeix, C.; Bensa, C.; Deschamps, R.; Creange, A.; Wahab, A.; Pelletier, J.; Heinzlef, O.; Labauge, P.; Guilloton, L.; Ahle, G.; Goudot, M.; Bigaut, K.; Laplaud, D.; Vukusic, S.; Lubetzki, C.; De Seze, J."
Applications of a picture fuzzy correlation coefficient in pattern analysis and decision-making,"Picture fuzzy set is an efficient tool for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness, particularly in situations that require assimilation of more dimensions of linguistic assessment such as human voting, feature selection, etc. The correlation coefficient of picture fuzzy sets is a tool to determine the association of two picture fuzzy sets. It has several applications in various disciplines like science, engineering, and management. The prominent applications include decision-making, pattern recognition, clustering analysis, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new correlation coefficient for picture fuzzy sets with the justification of its advantages. This correlation coefficient is better than the existing correlation coefficients and other such measures in the picture fuzzy theory because it considers the picture fuzzy set as a whole and also expresses the nature (positive or negative) as well as the extent of association between two PFSs. By performing some comparative analysis based on the computation of correlation degree and linguistic hedges, we establish the effectiveness of the suggested correlation measure over some available correlation measures in a picture fuzzy environment. Further, in the context of pattern recognition, we examine the performance of the proposed correlation measure over some existing picture fuzzy correlation measures. Finally, we apply the suggested picture fuzzy correlation coefficient to a decision-making problem involving the selection of an appropriate COVID-19 mask.",2021-07-12,Granul,"Singh, Surender; Ganie, Abdul Haseeb"

Impact of key meteorological parameters on the spread of COVID-19 in Mumbai: Correlation and Regression Analysis,"PurposeTo understand key meteorological parameters that influence the spread of COVID-19 in Mumbai, India (based on data from April 2020 - April 2021). MethodsThe meteorological parameters chosen were Temperature, Dew Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed. The underlying basic relationships between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 information for Mumbai was understood using Spearmans rank correlation coefficients. After establishing basic relationships, Linear analysis and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were used to figure out statistically significant weather parameters and model them to explain the best possible variance in the pandemic data. ResultsA model of temperature and windspeed could explain 17.3% and 8.3% of variance in Daily new cases and Daily recoveries respectively. As for deaths occurring due to the virus, a model comprising of only pressure best explains a variance of 17.3% in the data. Non-Linear modelling based on GAM confirms the findings of linear analysis and establishes certain non-linear relationships as well. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the class of Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) which show seasonality depending on weather conditions. The above article focuses on understanding the underlying relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological parameters that would help progress basic research and formulation of policies around the disease for each weather/season.

Empowering Virus Sequences Research through Conceptual Modeling,"The pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease has attracted attention towards the genetic mechanisms of viruses. We hereby present the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM), centered on the virus sequence and described from four perspectives: biological (virus type and hosts/sample), analytical (annotations and variants), organizational (sequencing project) and technical (experimental technology). VCM is inspired by GCM, our previously developed Genomic Conceptual Model, but it introduces many novel concepts, as viral sequences significantly differ from human genomes. When applied to SARS-CoV2 virus, complex conceptual queries upon VCM are able to replicate the search results of recent articles, hence demonstrating huge potential in supporting virology research. In addition to VCM, we also illustrate the data dictionary for patient’s phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. Our effort is part of a broad vision: availability of conceptual models for both human genomics and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if interconnected by the same human being, playing the role of virus host as well as provider of genomic and phenotype information.",2020-05-01,bioRxiv,"Bernasconi, Anna; Cankoglu, Arif; Pinoli, Pietro; Ceri, Stefano"

Modeling the Impact of Social Distancing and Targeted Vaccination on the Spread of COVID-19 through a Real City-Scale Contact Network,"We use mobile device data to construct empirical interpersonal physical contact networks in the city of Portland, Oregon, both before and after social distancing measures were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public's reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks, and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.",2021,,"Hartnett, Gavin Parker Edward Gulden Timothy Vardavas Raffaele Kravitz David"
Prevalence of Post-COVID-19 Cough One Year After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Study,"This multicenter study presents prevalence data and associated risk factors of post-COVID-19 cough one year after hospital discharge in COVID-19 survivors. Individuals recovered from COVID-19 at three public hospitals in Madrid (Spain) were scheduled for a telephonic interview. They were systematically asked about the presence of respiratory symptoms, e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough after hospital discharge. Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital records. Overall, 1,950 patients (47% women, mean age:61, SD:16 years) were assessed at 11.2 months (SD 0.5) after hospital discharge. Just 367 (18.8%) were completely free of any respiratory post-COVID -19 symptom. The prevalence of long-term cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue was 2.5%, 6.5%, 23.3%, and 61.2%, respectively. Clinical and hospitalization factors were not associated with long-term post-COVID-19 cough. In conclusion, the prevalence of post-COVID-19 cough one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.5% in subjects who had survived hospitalization for COVID-19.

Resilience and Higher Education Support as Protective Factors for Student Academic Stress and Depression During Covid-19 in the Netherlands,"Background: The corona pandemic has forced higher education (HE) institutes to transition to online learning, with subsequent implications for student wellbeing. Aims: This study explored influences on student wellbeing throughout the first wave of the corona crisis in the Netherlands by testing serial mediation models of the relationships between perceived academic stress, depression, resilience, and HE support. Methods: The Covid-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS) was used, with a total sample of 2,480 higher education students studying at InHolland Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Student subgroups were created, so that students with low and high perceived academic stress could be assessed, in addition to depressed and non-depressed students. Predictive model fit was tested using Macro PROCESS. Results: A significant serial mediation model for the total student sample was revealed, including protective mediating effects of resilience and HE support on the positive direct effect of perceived academic stress on depression. At subgroup level, significant (partial) predictive effects of resilience on depression scores were noted. A partial serial effect between resilience and HE support was found for students with low perceived stress levels, whereas a parallel partial mediation model was present among highly academically stressed students. Regarding non-depressed students, a full parallel mediation model was found, whereas the model for depressed students inadequately explained the data. Conclusions: Overall, resilience and HE support mediate the predictive effect of academic stress on depressive symptoms among students. In addition, substantial differences in model fit arise when inspecting the students on a subgroup level. These findings contribute to the gap in knowledge regarding student wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, in addition to providing novel insights on student subgroup dynamics. While Covid-19 restrictions continue to demand online learning, student wellbeing may be enhanced overall by targeting resilience and increasing awareness and availability of HE support services. The current study also highlights the need for differential approaches when examining wellbeing for specific student groups.",2021-10-21,Front Public Health,"Versteeg, Melissa; Kappe, Rutger"
PARPs and ADP-ribosylation in RNA biology: from RNA expression and processing to protein translation and proteostasis,"ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a posttranslational modification of proteins discovered nearly six decades ago, but many important questions remain regarding its molecular functions and biological roles, as well as the activity of the ADP-ribose (ADPR) transferase enzymes (PARP family members) that catalyze it. Growing evidence indicates that PARP-mediated ADPRylation events are key regulators of the protein biosynthetic pathway, leading from rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA synthesis, processing, and translation. In this review we describe the role of PARP proteins and ADPRylation in all facets of this pathway. PARP-1 and its enzymatic activity are key regulators of rDNA transcription, which is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. An emerging role of PARPs in alternative splicing of mRNAs, as well as direct ADPRylation of mRNAs, highlight the role of PARP members in RNA processing. Furthermore, PARP activity, stimulated by cellular stresses, such as viral infections and ER stress, leads to the regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Dysregulation of PARP activity in these processes can promote disease states. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of PARP family members and ADPRylation in gene regulation, mRNA processing, and protein abundance. Future studies in these areas will yield new insights into the fundamental mechanisms and a broader utility for PARP-targeted therapeutic agents.",2020-03-01,Genes Dev,"Kim, Dae-Seok; Challa, Sridevi; Jones, Aarin; Kraus, W.

Suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic,"OBJECTIVES: We decided to compare the incidence and spectrum of pelvic fractures in 2020 affected by the anti-pandemic measures due to COVID-19 with previous years 2018 and 2019. METHODS: This retrospective study included 391 patients treated at the author's clinic for pelvic fractures. From the medical records we recorded gender, age, mechanism of injury, trauma energy, fracture type based on the AO classification and severity of injury. RESULTS: As expected, we observed no difference in the number of fractures caused by simple falls. However, we failed to prove a reduction in the number of high-energy injuries. In contrary, we observed an increase in the number of high-energy injuries in the period between lockdowns (p=0.0375). A surprising result was a dramatic increase in suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic fractures, with 6 (2.2 %) in 2018 and 2019 compared to 13 (10 %) in 2020 alone (p=0.0017). CONCLUSION: We observed the increased number of suicidal attempts only on a limited number of specific patients with pelvic fractures; therefore, we cannot formulate any general conclusions regarding the incidence of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we consider this to be a warning signal highlighting the worsened population mental health due to COVID-19 pandemic (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 34).",2022,Bratisl Lek Listy,"Rezek, Jan; Sidlo, Krystof; Dzupa, Valer; Horacek, Jiri; Hulin, Ivan"
Remote eye-tracking for cognitive telerehabilitation and interactive school tasks in times of COVID-19,"In the attempt to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown, most countries have recently authorized and promoted the adoption of e-learning and remote teaching technologies, often with the support of teleconferencing platforms. Unfortunately, not all students can benefit from the adoption of such a surrogate of their usual school. We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child. As a solution to the problem, we developed a software (named SWYG) that only runs at the ""operator"" side of the communication, at the side of the videoconferencing software, and does not require to install other software in the child's computer. The preliminary results obtained are very promising and the software is ready to be deployed on a larger base. While this paper is being written, several children are finally able to communicate with their caregivers from home, without relying on expensive and cumbersome devices.",2020,Information,"Iannizzotto, Giancarlo; Nucita, Andrea; Fabio, Rosa Angela; Caprì, Tindara; Bello, Lucia Lo"
"Laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance pilot project on select cruise ships in Alaska, 2013–15()","BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks can occur among passengers and crews during the Alaska summertime cruise season. Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013–2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2–3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.",2017-10-06,Journal of Travel Medicine,"Rogers, Kimberly B.; Roohi, Shahrokh; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Montgomery, David; Parker, Jayme; Fowler, Nisha H.; Xu, Xiyan; Ingram, Deandra J.; Fearey, Donna; Williams, Steve M.; Tarling, Grant; Brown, Clive M.; Cohen, Nicole J."

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using disposable strips and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor platform,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide. Currently, the most common detection methods for the virus are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow tests. PCR takes more than an hour to obtain the results and lateral flow tests have difficulty with detecting the virus at low concentrations. In this study, 60 clinical human saliva samples, which included 30 positive and 30 negative samples confirmed with RT-PCR, were screened for COVID-19 using disposable glucose biosensor strips and a reusable printed circuit board. The disposable strips were gold plated and functionalized to immobilize antibodies on the gold film. After functionalization, the strips were connected to the gate electrode of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor on the printed circuit board to amplify the test signals. A synchronous double-pulsed bias voltage was applied to the drain of the transistor and strips. The resulting change in drain waveforms was converted to digital readings. The RT-PCR-confirmed saliva samples were tested again using quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine cycling threshold (Ct) values. Ct values up to 45 refer to the number of amplification cycles needed to detect the presence of the virus. These PCR results were compared with digital readings from the sensor to better evaluate the sensor technology. The results indicate that the samples with a range of Ct values from 17.8 to 35 can be differentiated, which highlights the increased sensitivity of this sensor technology. This research exhibits the potential of this biosensor technology to be further developed into a cost-effective, point-of-care, and portable rapid detection method for SARS-CoV-2.",2022,Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B,"Chiu, C.

Thoracic fluid content: a novel parameter for predicting failed weaning from mechanical ventilation,"BACKGROUND: Weaning of patients from the mechanical ventilation remains one of the critical decisions in intensive care unit. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57–0.8], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72–1], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic fluid content showed moderate ability for predicting weaning outcome in surgical critically ill patients.

Smart and Contactless Person Identification System in the COVID 19 Pandemic Process,"The Covid 19 Pandemic has had an impact on many aspects of our daily lives such as Restricting contact through touch, wearing masks, practicing social distancing, staying indoors which has led to change in our behaviors and prioritized the importance of safety hygiene. We travel to different places such as Schools, Colleges, Restaurants, offices, and Hospitals. How do we adapt to these changes and refrain from getting the virus? Luckily, we have the technology to aid us. We are all used to biometric systems for marking our Presence/ Attendance in places like colleges, Offices, and Schools with fingerprint sensors, fingerprint sensors use our Fingerprint to mark our presence however Covid 19 has restricted the use of touch causing problems in marking attendance. One way to resolve the problem is using Artificial Intelligence by using a Recognizer to identify people with their face and iris features. We implement the Face Recognition and the Iris Recognition using two models which run concurrently, one to Recognize the Face by extracting the features of the face and passing the 128-d points to the Neural Network (Mobile net and Resnet Architecture). which gives the identity of the person whose image was matched with the trained database and the other by extracting iris features to recognize people. For extracting iris features we use the Gabor filter to extract features from the eyes which are then matched in the database for recognition using 3 distance-based matching algorithms city block distance, Euclidean distance, and cosine distance which gives an accuracy of 88.19%, 84.95%, and 85.42% respectively. The face Recognizer model yields an Accuracy of 98%, while Iris Recognizer yields an accuracy of 88%.

The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on migraine disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with migraine. METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. An increase in telehealth consultations with specialists was reported in the survey but migraine patients preferred face-to-face consultations.",2021,J. neurol,"Haghdoost, Faraidoon; Carcel, Cheryl; Chandrasekhar, Deepak; Rodgers, Anthony; Delcourt, Candice"
SARS in Singapore: surveillance strategies in a globalising city,"Public health measures employed to fight against the spread of SARS need to be guided by biomedical knowledge as well as an understanding of the social science aspects of the disease. Using Singapore as a case study, we explore how the state constructs the disease and implements measures targeted at creating a ring of defense around the island and using surveillance to monitor and prevent its spread. While there is support, there is also resentment among some Singaporeans who complain that their right to privacy has been invaded and that over surveillance may have actually occurred. Marginalisation and discrimination have not only affected the local population but in this open economy which is striving to achieve global city status, businesses, tourism, foreign talent, foreign contract workers and foreign students studying in Singapore have also been negatively affected. While Singapore has been applauded by WHO and used as an example of quick and effective response, a holistic approach to the management of infectious disease must address the social implications of strategies that are drawn from medical knowledge alone because it impinges on the social lives of people and how people interact with each other under stressful circumstances.",2004-12-07,Health Policy,"Teo, Peggy; Yeoh, Brenda S.A.; Ong, Shir Nee"
Public and health policy for the aged in Africa to the South of Saara,"OBJECTIVE: to know the social and health responses for the elderly in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: An integrative literature review. RESULTS: There is a lack of specialized health care to meet the real needs of the elderly, and the shortage of health professionals does not contribute favorably to this situation. There is a small number of facilities for the elderly and most of them are inadequate. Although there are models of care as well as social and health support policies for the elderly, there are still inequities/inequalities in access to these policies, especially for the most disadvantaged populations. CONCLUSION: Social and health policies for the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa are below standard and appropriate economic, political and social intervention is required.",2020,Rev Bras Enferm,"Assunção, Marta Regina Soares de; Pinto, Susana Isabel Mendes; José, Helena Maria Guerreiro"

Therapeutic Effectiveness of Interferon-α2b Against COVID-19: The Cuban Experience,"A prospective observational study was conducted for assessing the therapeutic efficacy of interferon (IFN)-&#945;2b in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first month after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Cuba. From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba. Seven hundred sixty-one (93.4%) were treated with a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-&#945;2b (Heberon® Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. Fifty-three patients received the approved COVID protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and nondetectable virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction) was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.01). The case fatality rate (CFR) for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-&#945;2b the CFR was reduced to 0.92. Intensive care was required for 82 patients (10.1%), 42 (5.5%) had been treated with IFN. This report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-&#945;2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery of patients.",2020,J Interferon Cytokine Res,"Pereda, Ricardo; González, Daniel; Rivero, Hubert Blas; Rivero, Juan Carlos; Pérez, Albadio; López, Lissette Del Rosario; Mezquia, Natacha; Venegas, Rafael; Betancourt, Julio Roberto; Domínguez, Rodolfo Emilio"
COVID-Well Study: Qualitative Evaluation of Supported Wellbeing Centres and Psychological First Aid for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Supported wellbeing centres were set up in UK hospital trusts as an early intervention aimed at mitigating the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers. These provided high quality rest spaces with peer-to-peer psychological support provided by National Health Service (NHS) staff volunteers called 'wellbeing buddies', trained in psychological first aid. The aim of the study was to explore the views of centre visitors and operational staff towards this COVID-19 workforce wellbeing provision. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty-four (20F, 4M) employees from an acute hospital trust in the UK. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, data were handled and analysed using thematic analysis. Interviews generated 3 over-arching themes, and 13 sub-themes covering 'exposure and job roles', 'emotional impacts of COVID-19 and 'the wellbeing centres'. Supported wellbeing centres were viewed as critical for the wellbeing of hospital employees during the first surge of COVID-19 in the UK. Wellbeing initiatives require managerial advocacy and must be inclusive. Job-related barriers to work breaks and accessing staff wellbeing provisions should be addressed. High quality rest spaces and access to peer-to-peer support are seen to benefit individuals, teams, organisations and care quality. Training NHS staff in psychological first aid is a useful approach to supporting the wellbeing of the NHS workforce during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),"Blake, Holly; Gupta, Alisha; Javed, Mahnoor; Wood, Ben; Knowles, Steph; Coyne, Emma; Cooper, Joanne"
Maternal solitude before the new guidelines in SARS-COV-2 times: a Brazilian cutting.,"AIM To reflect on the lonely experience of women during the pregnancy-puerperal cycle in times of pandemic by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHOD Theoretical-reflective study on the new Brazilian guidelines for care for women during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum in times of Covid-19 and its influence on the exacerbation of maternal loneliness. The discussion about the transformations of women in this period refers to Maldonado's studies. RESULTS Motherhood is a lonely process for women. The new technical norms that are in force bring important changes in the assistance to this cycle, mainly with regard to the importance of social distance, which intensifies the feeling of loneliness and helplessness. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS This reflection can guide health professionals, especially the work of nurses in the scope of obstetrics, so that during the assistance to women in the pregnancy-puerperal cycle, they pay attention to the subtlety of feelings of loneliness that can interfere with maternal well-being fetal.",2021,Revista gaucha de enfermagem,"Paixão, Gilvânia Patrícia do Nascimento; Campos, Luana Moura; Carneiro, Jordana Brock; Fraga, Chalana Duarte de Sena"
The Methodology and Application of a Migration with Dignity Framework,"The scale of migration is increasing, and while great uncertainty exists in identifying exact numbers, the estimated number of international migrants is already surpassing 2050 projections in the order of 2.6%, or 230 million. As people migrate, they face a number of challenges including exposure to disease and other health threats, violence and assualt, trafficking and unlawful detention. However, of the protections avail-able to migrants, the implementation and realization of these protections and how they impact the individual experiences of migrants and their loss of human rights and dignity rights across the migration cycle, are lacking. In acknowledgement of this, McClain et al. developed a legal and policy framework for Migration with Dignity, which identified six fundamental elements central to the migration experience that can supplement and support the implementation of migrant protections. The framework was built upon the foundational policy of former President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, who understood the climate change was impacting the lives and livelihoods of his people and that in the face of diminishing land area and opportunities, that the Kiribati should have the opportunity to determine when and how they migrate, and that in doing so that they are able to live a life that is equal to or better than the one they left behind. The Migration with Dignity framework offers an opportunity to provide policy and legal options to governments, policy makers, and NGO’s for how to improve to consider the dignity of migrants while they move, and improve the transition of migrants into new set-tings, while also fostering opportunities for improved livelihoods. However, in order to provide these opportunities, the framework would benefit from additional application of the fundamental elements across different contexts and in different settings. With this in mind, this article provides the necessary methodology for considering the social and legal dimensions of the framework, it also provides examples for how to apply the framework across multiple contexts. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.",2022,Journal of Disaster Research,"McClain, S.

A Caveat to Using Wearable Sensor Data for COVID-19 Detection: The Role of Behavioral Change after Receipt of Test Results,"Recent studies indicate that wearable sensors have the potential to capture subtle within-person changes that signal SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it remains unclear the extent to which observed discriminative performance is attributable to behavioral change after receiving test results. We conducted a retrospective study in a sample of medical interns who received COVID-19 test results from March to December 2020. Our data confirmed that sensor data were able to differentiate between symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with good accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75). However, removing post-result data substantially reduced discriminative capacity (0.75 to 0.63; delta= −0.12, p=0.013). Removing data in the symptomatic period prior to receipt of test results did not produce similar reductions in discriminative capacity. These findings suggest a meaningful proportion of the discriminative capacity of wearable sensor data for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to behavior change after receiving test results.",2021-04-22,medRxiv,"Cleary, Jennifer L.; Fang, Yu; Sen, Srijan; Wu, Zhenke"
How do policy levers shape the quality of a national health system?,"Poor quality of care may have a detrimental effect on access and take-up and can become a serious barrier to the universality of health services. This consideration is of particular interest in view of the fact that health systems in many countries must address a growing public-sector deficit and respond to increasing pressures due to COVID-19 and aging population, among other factors. In line with a rapidly emerging literature, we focus on patient satisfaction as a proxy for quality of health care. Drawing on rich longitudinal and cross-sectional data for Spain and multilevel estimation techniques, we show that in addition to individual level differences, policy levers (such as public health spending and the patient-doctor ratio, in particular) exert a considerable influence on the quality of a health care system. Our results suggest that policymakers seeking to enhance the quality of care should be cautious when compromising the level of health resources, and in particular, health personnel, as a response to economic downturns in a sector that traditionally had insufficient human resources in many countries, which have become even more evident in the light of the current health crisis. Additionally, we provide evidence that the increasing reliance on the private health sector may be indicative of inefficiencies in the public system and/or the existence of features of private insurance which are deemed important by patients.",2021-10-21,J Policy Model,"García-Corchero, Juan David; Jiménez-Rubio, Dolores"

Gendering boundary work: Experiences of work–family practices among Finnish working parents during COVID‐19 lockdown,"In the spring of 2020, the COVID‐19 outbreak and governmental lockdowns changed the everyday lives of families with children worldwide. Due to remote work recommendations and the closing of school premises and childcare centers, work–family boundaries became blurred in many families. In this study, we examine the possibly gendered boundary work practices among Finnish parents during the COVID‐19 lockdown in spring 2020 by asking, how do parents perceive the blurring of work–family boundaries? What kind of boundary work practices did families develop to manage their work and family roles, and were these practices gendered and how? Boundary practices are analyzed by combining theories of doing boundaries and gender theories in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic and applying them to survey data. The results revealed that during lockdown, both spatial and temporal boundaries blurred or partly disappeared, and boundary practices developed by families were highly gendered. Especially in families where childcare practices had been gendered already before the lockdown, it was predominantly mothers, who shouldered the main responsibility of increased childcare and struggled to manage their work duties. Hence, families had varying means to cope with blurring boundaries based on their ability to switch to remote work, but also on their work–family practices before the pandemic.",2021-11-13,Gend Work Organ,"Otonkorpi‐Lehtoranta, Katri; Salin, Milla; Hakovirta, Mia; Kaittila, Anniina"
Spatiotemporal Characteristics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States,"BACKGROUND: A range of near-real-time online/mobile mapping dashboards and applications have been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% – -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% – 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.",2020-07-08,Clin Infect Dis,"Wang, Yun; Liu, Ying; Struthers, James; Lian, Min"
Effective method of gallbladder retraction for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"INTRODUCTION Recently, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been accepted as an alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of unique gallbladder retraction methods using an ENDOLOOP® (Ethicon, Tokyo, Japan) and Lapaherclosure™ (Hakko Medical, Tokyo, Japan). MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE From May 2013 to April 2015, 77 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this retraction technique. During the same period, conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 85 patients; these patients were the control group. The patients' data, including the operative time, total blood loss, conversion rate to laparotomy, and perioperative complications, were compared. Alexis® Wound Retractor XS (Applied Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through a 25-30-mm vertical transumbilical incision to prevent bile contamination. Next, a SILS Port (Covidien, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope was inserted through the port with a grasper (SILS Clinch, Covidien) and a normal 5-mm scalpel. The fundus of the gallbladder was tied by the ENDOLOOP. The Lapaherclosure was then directly inserted through a right lower intercostal space to capture and pull the Lapaherclosure out. After the cystic artery and duct were cut, the resected gallbladder was directly extracted from the umbilical incision. DISCUSSION Several methods and devices have been developed to perform single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including the suturing method, the Mini Loop Retractor II (Covidien), and the EndoGrab (Virtual Ports, Caesarea, Israel). However, considering medical costs and safety, our retraction method seems to be feasible and comparable to existing methods.",2019,Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,"Funamizu, Naotake; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Kumamoto, Tomotaka; Kazama, Takashi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Fujioka, Shuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko"
What Can We Learn from the Time Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Slovenia?,"A recent work indicates that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterward, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia is investigated with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate &#954; by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the &#954;-value by &#8776;15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economic life wherein wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social science, our analysis may reveal an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.",2021,Adv Theory Simul,"Bâldea, Ioan"
Reuse of face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 99% of adults in Hong Kong use face masks in public. With the limited supply of face masks in the market and the uncertainty about the future development of COVID-19, reusing face masks is a legitimate way to reduce usage. Although this practice is not recommended, reusing face masks is common in Hong Kong. This study aimed to examine the practice of reusing face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with their health beliefs toward this health crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. A quota sample of 1000 adults was recruited in Hong Kong in April 2020. Guided by the Health Belief Model, the subjects were invited to answer questions on their practice of reusing face masks and health beliefs toward COVID-19 through telephone interview. Their practice on reuse, storage, and decontamination of used face masks were summarized by descriptive statistics. The difference in health beliefs between the subjects who reused and did not reuse face masks was examined by conducting an independent t test. The association between health beliefs and reuse of face masks was determined by conducting a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One-third (n = 345, 35.4%) of the subjects reused face masks in an average of 2.5 days. Among them, 207 subjects stored and 115 subjects decontaminated their used face masks by using various methods. The subjects who reused face masks significantly perceived having inadequate face masks (t = 3.905; p < 0.001). Having a higher level of perception of having inadequate face masks increased the likelihood of reusing face masks (OR = 0.784; CI 95%: 0.659–0.934; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Despite having 90 face masks in stock, the adults who reused face masks significantly perceived that they had inadequate face masks. Concerted effort of health care professionals, community organizations, and the government will improve individuals’ practice in use of face masks and alleviate their actual and perceived feeling of having inadequate face masks, which lead them to reuse.",2021-06-29,BMC Public Health,"Lee, Linda Yin-king; Chan, Issac Chun-wing; Wong, Owen Pak-man; Ng, Yaki Hoi-ying; Ng, Crystal Kit-ying; Chan, Max Hin-wa; Ng, Joe Ka-chun; Koo, Hailey Hei-tung; Lam, Suk-ting; Chu, Ada Cho-wai; Wong, Rachel Yuen-shan; Leung, Heidi Po-ying; Pun, Angel Lok-ching"
P0247 Management of acute ureteric colic in a large tertiary centre during the initial COVID-19 pandemic - How did our practice change?,"Introduction & Objectives: Treatment of acute ureteric colic according to current BAUS guidelines can be challenging, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to audit our practice during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Materials & Methods: A retrospective analysis of 94 patients admitted with ureteric colic during the initial COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). Data was collected from records and outcomes compared to a pre-pandemic audit of our acute stone service (January to June 2018). Results: Patient demographics were comparable: 33 admissions/month (pre-COVID 37), average age 52 years (pre-COVID 53 years), and median stone size 6 mm (pre-COVID 5mm). Septic patients (23%, pre-COVID 17%) underwent ureteric stenting (23%, pre-COVID 17%) or nephrostomy (10%, pre-COVID <1%). For non-septic patients, 46% underwent primary treatment (ureteroscopy:ESWL = 1:1, pre-COVID = 2:1), 24% ureteric stenting (pre-COVID 31%) and 30% conservative management (pre-COVID 34%). Median time to primary ureteroscopy (94% successful) and ESWL (76% successful;1-2 sessions) was 24 hours (target <48 hours). Median time from stent insertion to definite ureteroscopy was 5.8 weeks (pre-COVID 6.6 weeks, target <4 weeks) and subsequent cystoscopic stent removal was 4 weeks (target <2 weeks). For patients managed conservatively, median time to outpatient review was 7.1 weeks (pre-COVID 5.4 weeks, target <4 weeks) and follow-up imaging 8.2 weeks. Conclusions: These results from one of the largest stone units in the UK show, that despite the pandemic, primary stone intervention was still achievable within 24 hours. There was a greater reliance on ESWL and nephrostomy insertion due to concerns regarding general anaesthesia and COVID-19.",2021-06-30,European Urology,"Rizvi, I.

"Sex, gender and COVID-19: a call to action","An understanding of the influence of sex (biological attributes) and gender (socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions, identities) factors on the risk of infection, hospitalization and death is of urgent importance in the COVID-19 pandemic response effort. Despite similar global rates of infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic), hospitalizations and mortality are higher in men than in women. Females may be less vulnerable to viral infection due to sex-based differences in immune responses and renin-angiotensin system activity. The response and side effects of currently studied potential therapies for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, likely differ by sex. Women form the majority of the health care workforce and a uniform approach to sizing of personal protective equipment may provide differing levels of protection from viral infection to health care workers of varying shapes and sizes. Important gender differences exist in the response to public health measures to prevent and contain spread of COVID-19, as well as presentation for testing and medical care, which may inadvertently propagate viral spread. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender, as well as measures of intersectionality, are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.",2020,Can. j. public health,"Ahmed, Sofia B; Dumanski, Sandra M"

"A proposal to leverage high-quality veterinary diagnostic laboratory large data streams for animal health, public health, and One Health","Test data generated by ~60 accredited member laboratories of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) is of exceptional quality. These data are captured by 1 of 13 laboratory information management systems (LIMSs) developed specifically for veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs). Beginning ~2000, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) developed an electronic messaging system for LIMS to automatically send standardized data streams for 14 select agents to a national repository. This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs. Further, VDLs are the only state and federal resources that can provide early detection and identification of endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are estimated to be responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths worldwide every year. The economic and health impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is self-evident. We review here the history and progress of data management in VDLs and discuss ways of seizing unexplored opportunities to advance data leveraging to better serve animal health, public health, and One Health.",2021,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Carter, Craig N; Smith, Jacqueline L"

A consideration of convalescent plasma and plasma derivatives in the care of Severely-ill patients with COVID-19,"The pathogenesis and immunopathological damage of severe forms of COVID-19 resemble acute autoimmune disease sparked by SARS-CoV-2, including an early systemic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Such immunopathological features provide a rationale for the use of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma as a source of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies and of anti-inflammatory plasma components. While convalescent plasma therapy is now being evaluated in prospective clinical trials, we further consider the therapeutic potential of human hyper immune globulins, and of heterologous, engineered and monoclonal neutralizing antibodies as anti-viral agents to treat COVID-19. Good medical practice procedures are still needed and is why we also discuss the potential use of polyclonal polyspecific immunoglobulins (IVIG), a therapeutic plasma derivative, with potent anti-inflammatory activity, in severe forms of Covid-19.",2020-09-05,Transfus Apher Sci,"Lung, Thomas; Kazatchkine, Michel D.; Risch, Lorenz; Risch, Martin; Nydegger, Urs E."
Collaboration Structures in COVID-19 Critical Care: Retrospective Network Analysis Study,"BACKGROUND: Few intensive care unit (ICU) staffing studies have examined the collaboration structures of health care workers (HCWs). Knowledge about how HCWs are connected to the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is important for characterizing the relationships among team structures, care quality, and patient safety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discover differences in the teamwork structures of COVID-19 critical care by comparing HCW collaborations in the management of critically ill patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used network analysis methods to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of 76 critically ill patients (with COVID-19: n=38; without COVID-19: n=38) who were admitted to a large academic medical center, and to learn about HCW collaboration. We used the EHRs of adult patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 ICU at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee, United States) between March 17, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We matched each patient according to age, gender, and their length of stay. Patients without COVID-19 were admitted to the medical ICU between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. We used two sociometrics—eigencentrality and betweenness—to quantify HCWs’ statuses in networks. Eigencentrality characterizes the degree to which an HCW is a core person in collaboration structures. Betweenness centrality refers to whether an HCW lies on the path of other HCWs who are not directly connected. This sociometric was used to characterize HCWs’ broad skill sets. We measured patient staffing intensity in terms of the number of HCWs who interacted with patients’ EHRs. We assessed the statistical differences in the core and betweenness statuses of HCWs and the patient staffing intensities of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 critical care, by using Mann-Whitney U tests and reporting 95% CIs. RESULTS: HCWs in COVID-19 critical care were more likely to frequently work with each other (eigencentrality: median 0.096) than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (eigencentrality: median 0.057; P<.001). Internal medicine physicians in COVID-19 critical care had higher core statuses than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (P=.001). Nurse practitioners in COVID-19 care had higher betweenness statuses than those in non–COVID-19 care (P<.001). Compared to HCWs in non–COVID-19 settings, the EHRs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were used by a larger number of internal medicine nurse practitioners (P<.001), cardiovascular nurses (P<.001), and surgical ICU nurses (P=.002) and a smaller number of resident physicians (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis methodologies and data on EHR use provide a novel method for learning about differences in collaboration structures between COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 critical care. Health care organizations can use this information to learn about the novel changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed on collaboration structures in urgent care.",2021-03-08,JMIR Hum Factors,"Yan, Chao; Zhang, Xinmeng; Gao, Cheng; Wilfong, Erin; Casey, Jonathan; France, Daniel; Gong, Yang; Patel, Mayur; Malin, Bradley; Chen, You"
Harnessing the immune system via FcγR function in immune therapy: a pathway to next‐gen mAbs,"The human fragment crystallizable (Fc)γ receptor (R) interacts with antigen‐complexed immunoglobulin (Ig)G ligands to both activate and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host‐protective effector functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens. More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR‐mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody‐dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a “scaffolding” role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent “next‐gen” therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FcγR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.",2020-04-12,Immunol Cell Biol,"Chenoweth, Alicia M; Wines, Bruce D; Anania, Jessica C; Mark Hogarth, P"
Techniques for lung surgery: a review of robotic lobectomy.,"INTRODUCTION Robotic lobectomy is an increasingly common surgical approach for anatomic lung resection. Over the last decade, robotic lobectomy has shown to be safe, with oncologic efficacy similar to lobectomy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Comparative analysis between these modalities is an active area of investigation. While initially expensive, the costs of a robotic platform decrease as the number of operations performed increases, length of stay is shortened, and postoperative morbidity is reduced. Moreover, the added cost has value which is defined over long periods of time. Areas covered: The clinical technique and optimal conduct of lobectomy is explained in granular detail for all five types of lobectomies. The advantages and disadvantages of a robotic platform are analyzed, including a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary: The number of robotic pulmonary resections performed has tripled in the past two years. Anticipated developments in robotic surgery include improvements in robotic training, continued refinement of robotic instrumentation, and additional adjunctive technologies. The overall costs of robotic surgery will decrease, in part, due to increasing competition as additional companies enter the market.",2018,Expert review of respiratory medicine,"Chen, Sophia; Geraci, Travis C; Cerfolio, Robert James"

Convalescent Plasma: The Relay Baton in the Race for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Treatment,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most infected people have mild or moderate symptoms and recover without the need for extensive treatment. However, for seriously ill patients, no specific treatments are currently available. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), a passive immunotherapy, involves infusing plasma from recovered people into actively infected people, and is thought to be a specific intervention to improve outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. The presumed mechanism involves neutralizing antibodies and antibody dependent cytotoxicity/phagocytosis. Previous CPT trials showed an effect in SARS and pilot studies suggest CPT is an effective and safe strategy for seriously ill COVID-19 patients. CPT is currently being tested in large randomized clinical trials. Herein, we critically review the mechanism, applications and the challenges for CPT in the treatment of severe COVID-19, paving the way toward vaccine and immunotherapy development.",2020,Front Immunol,"Ouyang, Jing; Isnard, Stéphane; Lin, John; Fombuena, Brandon; Peng, Xiaorong; Routy, Jean-Pierre; Chen, Yaokai"

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a novel target of the γ-secretase complex,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, but also the functional receptor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on structural similarity with other γ-secretase (γS) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by γS proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by γS, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of γS results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of γS does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.",2021-05-07,Sci Rep,"Bartolomé, Alberto; Liang, Jiani; Wang, Pengfei; Ho, David D.; Pajvani, Utpal B."
In silico and In vitro Studies Reveal Complement System Drives Coagulation Cascade in SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,"The emergence and continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in a public health emergency across the globe. The lack of knowledge on the precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is impeding medical intervention. In this study, we have taken both in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism of viral pathogenesis associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection. Collectively both in silico and in vitro studies suggest complement and coagulation cascade signaling are a mechanism for intravascular coagulation, thrombotic changes, and associated complications in severe COVID-19 patients.",2020,,"Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R; Mikaeloff, Flora; Gupta, Soham; Mirazimi, Ali; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Neogi, Ujjwal; Nayak, Debasis"
Examining Procrastination among University Students through the Lens of the Self-Regulated Learning Model,"Generally considered as a prevalent occurrence in academic settings, procrastination was analyzed in association with constructs such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, anxiety, stress, and fear of failure. This study investigated the role played by self-regulated learning strategies in predicting procrastination among university students. To this purpose, the relationships of procrastination with cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies and time management were explored in the entire sample, as well as in male and female groups. Gender differences were taken into account due to the mixed results that emerged in previous studies. This cross-sectional study involved 450 university students (M = 230; F = 220; Mage = 21.08, DS = 3.25) who completed a self-reported questionnaire including a sociodemographic section, the Tuckman Procrastination Scale, the Time Management Scale, and the Metacognitive Self-Regulation and Critical Thinking Scales. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied to the data. The main findings indicated that temporal and metacognitive components play an important role in students’ academic achievement and that, compared to females, males procrastinate more due to poor time management skills and metacognitive strategies. Practical implications were suggested to help students to overcome their dilatory behavior.",2020-12-01,Behav Sci (Basel),"Limone, Pierpaolo; Sinatra, Maria; Ceglie, Flavio; Monacis, Lucia"

Relationship between the treatment and the evolution of the clinical course in scouring Merino lambs from “La Serena” (Southwest Spain),"This work investigated the link between the type of treatment and the clinical evolution of lambs suffering from diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli + Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli.",2008-03-05,Small Rumin Res,"Gómez, L.; Andrés, S.; Sánchez, J.; Alonso, J.M.; Rey, J.; López, F.; Jiménez, A."

"Protocol for an interdisciplinary cross-sectional study investigating the social, biological and community-level drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR): Holistic Approach to Unravelling Antibiotic Resistance in East Africa (HATUA)","Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat that requires urgent research using a multidisciplinary approach. The biological drivers of AMR are well understood, but factors related to treatment-seeking and the social contexts of antibiotic (AB) use behaviours are less understood. Here we describe the Holistic Approach to Unravelling Antibacterial Resistance in East Africa (HATUA), a multi-centre consortium that investigates the diverse drivers of drug-resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) in East Africa. Methods and Analysis: This study will take place in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. We will conduct geospatial mapping of AB sellers, and conduct mystery client studies and in-depth interviews (IDI) with drug sellers to investigate AB provision practices. In parallel, we will conduct IDIs with doctors, alongside community focus groups. Clinically diagnosed UTI patients will be recruited from healthcare centres, provide urine samples, and complete a questionnaire capturing retrospective treatment pathways, socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes and knowledge. Bacterial isolates from urine and stool samples will be subject to culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing (C&AST). Genomic DNA from bacterial isolates will be extracted with a subset being sequenced. A follow-up household interview will be conducted with 1800 UTI-positive patients, where further environmental samples will be collected. A sub-sample of patients will be interviewed using qualitative tools. Questionnaire data, microbiological analysis and qualitative data will be linked at the individual level. Quantitative data will be analysed using statistical modelling including Bayesian network analysis, and all forms of qualitative data analysed through iterative thematic content analysis. Ethics and Dissemination: Approvals have been obtained from all national and local ethical review bodies in East Africa and the UK. Results will be disseminated in communities, with local and global policy stakeholders, and in academic circles. They will have great potential to inform policy, improve clinical practice and build regional pathogen surveillance capacity.",2020-12-22,,"Asiimwe, B. B.; Kiiru, J.; Mshana, S.

Early awake proning in critical and severe COVID-19 patients undergoing noninvasive respiratory support: A retrospective multicenter cohort study,"BACKGROUND/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two teaching hospitals over a 3-month period (March 2010-June 2020) comparing severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) and subjected to awake prone position (PP) with those receiving standard care (SC). Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRâ¯=â¯0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pâ¯=â¯0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRâ¯=â¯0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pâ¯=â¯0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRâ¯=â¯0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pâ¯=â¯0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC. Although our results are intriguing, further randomized controlled trials are needed to answer all the open questions remaining pending about the real efficacy of PP in this setting.",2021,"Pulmonology (Barc., Print)","Tonelli, Roberto; Pisani, Lara; Tabbì, Luca; Comellini, Vittoria; Prediletto, Irene; Fantini, Riccardo; Marchioni, Alessandro; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Bruzzi, Giulia; Manicardi, Linda; Busani, Stefano; Mussini, Cristina; Castaniere, Ivana; Bassi, Ilaria; Carpano, Marco; Tagariello, Federico; Corsi, Gabriele; d039,; Amico, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo; Nava, Stefano; Clini, Enrico"
How to purchase an order from brick and mortar retailers during COVID-19 pandemic? A rise of crowdshipping,"This paper aims to determine factors that affect consumers’ intention to re-purchase by combining consumers’ attitudes and satisfaction in mobile shopping via sharing economy platforms. The research sample consists of 367 valid participants in the metropolitan area of Ho Chi Minh City who experienced buying products from brick and mortar retailers by using crowdshipping service, using PLS-SEM. The results confirm that Personal Innovativeness significantly affected Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and trust. Consumers' attitudes toward buying products via crowdshipping services in sharing economy platforms are determined by PEOU and trust, and their satisfaction of an purchasement is impacted by Check out attributes and Delivery attributes, leading to re-purchase an order via this platform.

DNA nanoscaffold-based SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 diagnosis,"COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the 21st century. It has been determined to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15°C–35 °C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated. Therefore, DNHCR-based method is expected to provide a simple and faster alternative to the traditional SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay.",2020-07-29,Biosens Bioelectron,"Jiao, Jin; Duan, Chengjie; Xue, Lan; Liu, Yunfei; Sun, Weihao; Xiang, Yang"

Recent advances in targeted drug delivery systems for resistant colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest cancers in the world, the incidences and morality rate are rising and poses an important threat to the public health. It is known that multiple drug resistance (MDR) is one of the major obstacles in CRC treatment. Tumor microenvironment plus genomic instability, tumor derived exosomes (TDE), cancer stem cells (CSCs), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as well as cellular signaling pathways are important issues regarding resistance. Since non-targeted therapy causes toxicity, diverse side effects, and undesired efficacy, targeted therapy with contribution of various carriers has been developed to address the mentioned shortcomings. In this paper the underlying causes of MDR and then various targeting strategies including exosomes, liposomes, hydrogels, cell-based carriers and theranostics which are utilized to overcome therapeutic resistance will be described.

A Propidium Monoazide (PMAxx)-Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) for the Detection of Viable Burkholderia cepacia Complex in Nuclease-Free Water and Antiseptics,"Pharmaceutical products contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) strains constitute a serious health issue for susceptible individuals. New detection methods to distinguish DNA from viable cells are required to ensure pharmaceutical product quality and safety. In this study, we have assessed a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with a variant propidium monoazide (PMAxx) for selective detection of live/dead BCC cells in autoclaved nuclease-free water after 365 days, in 0.001% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and in 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) solutions after 184 days. Using 10 μM PMAxx and 5 min light exposure, a proportion of dead BCC was quantified by ddPCR. The detection limit of culture-based method was 10(4) CFU/mL, equivalent to 9.7 pg/μL for B. cenocepacia J2315, while that of ddPCR was 9.7 fg/μL. The true positive rate from nuclease-free water and CHX using PMAxx-ddPCR assay was 60.0% and 38.3%, respectively, compared to 85.0% and 74.6% without PMAxx (p < 0.05), respectively. However, in BZK-treated cells, no difference in the detection rate was observed between the ddPCR assay on samples treated with PMAxx (67.1%) and without PMAxx (63.3%). This study shows that the PMAxx-ddPCR assay provides a better tool for selective detection of live BCC cells in non-sterile pharmaceutical products.",2022-04-30,Microorganisms,"Daddy Gaoh, Soumana; Kweon, Ohgew; Lee, Yong-Jin; Hussong, David; Marasa, Bernard; Ahn, Youngbeom"

The learning management system as a facilitative boundary object makes pivoting to online classes more tactical when adopting cultural-historical activity theory as an analytical lens, which can be used as a guide to re-envision how interactions can be implemented in e-learning or online courses and how instructors can repurpose resources and tools to maximize their instructional practices. Examples of interactivity and the implications for practitioners are synthesized, and the multiple components at play in the online and hybrid space are characterized in order to promote the exchange of practices and knowledge mobilization.",2021-03-01,SN Soc Sci,"Chang, Sharon; Kuo, Annie Camey"
Population genomics of Vibrionaceae isolated from an endangered oasis reveals local adaptation after an environmental perturbation,"BACKGROUND: In bacteria, pan-genomes are the result of an evolutionary “tug of war” between selection and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). High rates of HGT increase the genetic pool and the effective population size (N(e)), resulting in open pan-genomes. In contrast, selective pressures can lead to local adaptation by purging the variation introduced by HGT and mutation, resulting in closed pan-genomes and clonal lineages. In this study, we explored both hypotheses, elucidating the pan-genome of Vibrionaceae isolates after a perturbation event in the endangered oasis of Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, and looking for signals of adaptation to the environments in their genomes. RESULTS: We obtained 42 genomes of Vibrionaceae distributed in six lineages, two of them did not showed any close reference strain in databases. Five of the lineages showed closed pan-genomes and were associated to either water or sediment environment; their high N(e) estimates suggest that these lineages are not from a recent origin. The only clade with an open pan-genome was found in both environments and was formed by ten genetic groups with low N(e), suggesting a recent origin. The recombination and mutation estimators (r/m) ranged from 0.005 to 2.725, which are similar to oceanic Vibrionaceae estimations. However, we identified 367 gene families with signals of positive selection, most of them found in the core genome; suggesting that despite recombination, natural selection moves the Vibrionaceae CCB lineages to local adaptation, purging the genomes and keeping closed pan-genome patterns. Moreover, we identify 598 SNPs associated with an unstructured environment; some of the genes associated with these SNPs were related to sodium transport. CONCLUSIONS: Different lines of evidence suggest that the sampled Vibrionaceae, are part of the rare biosphere usually living under famine conditions. Two of these lineages were reported for the first time. Most Vibrionaceae lineages of CCB are adapted to their micro-habitats rather than to the sampled environments. This pattern of adaptation is concordant with the association of closed pan-genomes and local adaptation.",2020-06-22,BMC Genomics,"Vázquez-Rosas-Landa, Mirna; Ponce-Soto, Gabriel Yaxal; Aguirre-Liguori, Jonás A.; Thakur, Shalabh; Scheinvar, Enrique; Barrera-Redondo, Josué; Ibarra-Laclette, Enrique; Guttman, David S.; Eguiarte, Luis E.; Souza, Valeria"

Ultra-Processed Profits: The Political Economy of Countering the Global Spread of Ultra-Processed Foods - A Synthesis Review on the Market and Political Practices of Transnational Food Corporations and Strategic Public Health Responses.,"BACKGROUND Ultra-processed food (UPF) and Ultra-processed beverage (UPB) consumption is associated with higher risks of numerous non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Yet global consumption of these products is rising due to profound changes in production, processing, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and consumption practices, alongside the growth of the resources and political influence of Big Food. Whilst the sales of UPFs and UPBs in high-income countries (HICs) are stagnating, sales are rapidly expanding in more populous middle-income countries (MICs). In this paper, we adopt a political economy of food systems approach to understand how growth of Big Food in MICs drives the NCD pandemic. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods synthesis review. This involved quantitative data collection and development of descriptive statistics; a search for academic, market and grey literature on the expansion of UPF in MICs; and the development of themes, three illustrative case examples (South Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia), and synthesis of the enablers of successful campaigns in MICs into recommendations for public health campaigns. RESULTS We project that the combined sales volume of UPFs in MICs will reach equivalency with HICs by 2024, and the total sales volume of UPBs in MICs is already significantly higher than in HICs. Similarly, annual growth in UPF sales is higher in MICs compared to HICs. We also show how Big Food has entrenched its presence within MICs through establishing global production and hyper-local distribution networks, scaling up its marketing, challenging government policies and scientific expertise, and co-opting civil society. We argue that public health can counter the influence of Big Food by developing an expanded global network of driven and passionate people with diverse skillsets, and advocating for increased government leadership. CONCLUSION The projected increase in sales of UPFs and UPBs in MICs raises major concerns about the global capacity to prevent and treat NCDs.",2021-05-24,International journal of health policy and management,"Moodie, Rob; Bennett, Elizabeth; Kwong, Edwin Jit Leung; Santos, Thiago M; Pratiwi, Liza; Williams, Joanna; Baker, Phillip"
Document Re-ranking by Generality in Bio-medical Information Retrieval,"Document ranking is an important process in information retrieval (IR). It presents retrieved documents in an order of their estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document ranking methods are mostly based on the similarity computations between documents and query. In this paper we argue that the similarity-based document ranking is insufficient in some cases. There are two reasons. Firstly it is about the increased information variety. There are far too many different types documents available now for user to search. The second is about the users variety. In many cases user may want to retrieve documents that are not only similar but also general or broad regarding a certain topic. This is particularly the case in some domains such as bio-medical IR. In this paper we propose a novel approach to re-rank the retrieved documents by incorporating the similarity with their generality. By an ontology-based analysis on the semantic cohesion of text, document generality can be quantified. The retrieved documents are then re-ranked by their combined scores of similarity and the closeness of documents’ generality to the query’s. Our experiments have shown an encouraging performance on a large bio-medical document collection, OHSUMED, containing 348,566 medical journal references and 101 test queries.",2005,Web Information Systems Engineering - WISE 2005,"Yan, Xin; Li, Xue; Song, Dawei"

The Effects of Increased Glucose Level and the Role of Glycolysis on SARS CoV-2 Infection,"Covid-19 has entered our lives for a long time as an infection with high mortality rates. Although the vaccination process has provided benefits, the death toll remains to be frightening worldwide. Therefore, drugs and combined therapies that can be used against Covid-19 infection are still being investigated. Most of these antiviral medications are investigational drug candidates which are still in clinical trials. In this context, holistic and different approaches for the treatment of Covid-19 including prophylactic use of natural medicines are under investigation and may offer potential treatment options due to the fact that this is still an unmet medical need in the world. Thus, inhibiting the increased glycolysis on Covid-19 infection with glycolysis inhibitors may be beneficial for patient survival. This short review highlights the potential benefits of glycolysis inhibition as well as controlling the elevated glucose levels in patients with the treatment of Covid-19.",2022,Mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry (Online),"Ozlem Zurnaci, Fatma; Guzel, Mustafa"

Histopathological findings and viral tropism in UK patients with severe fatal COVID-19: a post-mortem study,"Background: Severe COVID-19 has a high mortality rate. Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

COVID-19 Impact in Neurosurgery Residency: Grit During Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID) pandemic has presented a significant challenge to health care providers. Neurosurgical patients are often critically ill and at particularly high risk for COVID, and the pandemic has produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow their continued care. This study explores the psychologic impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. METHODS: Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30), two validated surveys, before and during the pandemic. PSS scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively among residents and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 prepandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 prepandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant changes in perceived stress or depressive symptoms among neurosurgical residents during the pandemic.",2021,World neurosurgery (Online),"Algattas, Hanna; Roy, Souvik; Agarwal, Nitin; Maroon, Joseph"

The effect of lockdowns and infection rates on supermarket sales,"In this paper we document the evolution of the supermarket sales in one of the European countries, Spain, that has been most hardly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a very detailed dataset at the weekly and municipality level on the sales of a supermarket chain, we are able to separately identify the effects on sales for 12 different food products and for three population age groups. Furthermore, we distinguish between the impact of the lockdown, which affected the entire territory by mid-March, from the effect of the number of new confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at the municipal level. Our results show strong stockpiling effects for most of the products in the first week of adoption of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, the number of new cases at the municipal level is associated with reductions in sales, pointing towards increased fears of being infected as the main driver of the slowdown in sales. Finally, when we do a separate analysis for different age groups, we find no effects for individuals aged 66 and over.",2020,Econ Hum Biol,"Vall Castelló, Judit; Lopez Casasnovas, Guillem"

"Is plastidic glutamine synthetase essential for C3 plants? A tale of photorespiratory mutants, ammonium tolerance and conifers","Agriculture has the great challenge of adapting to a progressively changing climate (including the increase of CO2 levels and temperature), minimizing its environmental impact at the same time that crops yield needs to be maintained or increased to ensure food security. In this scenario increasing plants nitrogen (N) use efficiency and minimizing energy losses coming from photorespiration are long-pursued traits for crops breeding. Plastidic glutamine synthetase (GS2) enzyme stands at the crossroad of N assimilation and photorespiration and thus, appears as a key candidate for the improvement of crops performance. GS2 has been considered for a long time as an essential enzyme for angiosperms survival under photorespiratory conditions. Surprisingly, in Arabidopsis, GS2 is not essential for plant survival and its absence confers tolerance towards ammonium stress, which clashes with the traditional assumption that NH4 + accumulation is a main cause of ammonium stress. Altogether, it appears that the GS2 ""textbook"" view of this enzyme must be revisited, especially regarding: 1) its essentiality for plants growth under photorespiratory conditions and 2) the role of NH4 + assimilation during ammonium stress. In this sense, in this article we open the debate whether ""more or less"" GS2 is a desirable trait for plants productivity.",2022,The New phytologist,"Marino, Daniel; Cañas, Rafael A; Betti, Marco"
Lymphopenia in COVID‐19: Therapeutic opportunities,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is uncontrollably spread all over the world. The host immune responses strongly try to confront it with all the potential cells and cytokines. With chronically condition of SARS‐CoV‐2, natural killer cells and T cells become exhausted and decreasing their count leads to lymphopenia. Inability to eradicate the infected organ makes hyperinitiation of the immune system, which releases the excessive inflammatory cytokines to compensate the exhausted one as well as the low lymphocytes counts; it consequently leads to the cytokine storm syndrome. These mechanisms and the potential therapeutic targeting are discussed in this paper.",2020-06-03,Cell Biol Int,"Fathi, Nazanin; Rezaei, Nima"

Mortality among solid organ waitlist candidates during COVID-19 in the United States,"We examined the effects of COVID-19 on solid organ waiting list mortality in the United States and compared effects across patient demographics (e.g., race, age, and sex) and donation service areas. Three separate piecewise exponential survival models estimated for each solid organ the overall, demographic-specific, and donation service area-specific differences in the hazard of waitlist mortality before and after the national emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. Kidney waiting list mortality was higher after than before the national emergency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23-1.52). The hazard of waitlist mortality was not significantly different before and after COVID-19 for liver (aHR, 0.94), pancreas (aHR, 1.01), lung (aHR, 1.00), and heart (aHR, 0.94). Kidney candidates had notable variability in differences across donation service areas (aHRs, New York City, 2.52; New Jersey, 1.84; and Michigan, 1.56). The only demographic group with increased waiting list mortality were Blacks versus Whites (aHR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07-1.86) for kidney candidates. The first 10 weeks after the declaration of a national emergency had a heterogeneous effect on waitlist mortality rate, varying by geography and ethnicity.

Dodging the Bundle - Persistent Healthcare-Associated Rhinovirus Infection throughout the Pandemic.,"INTRODUCTION Healthcare-associated viral infections (HAVI) are a common cause of patient harm in the pediatric population. We implemented a HAVI prevention bundle in 2015, which included 6 core elements: caregiver screening, symptom-based isolation, personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, staff illness procedures, and monitoring of environmental cleanliness. Enhanced bundle elements were introduced at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided an opportunity to observe the effectiveness of the bundle with optimal adherence to prevention practices, and to measure the impact on respiratory HAVI epidemiology. METHODS Respiratory HAVIs were confirmed through review of medical records and application of the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance criteria for upper respiratory infections (URIs) with pre-determined incubation periods for unit attribution. Descriptive statistics of the study population were examined, and comparative analyses were performed on demographic and process metrics. Data analysis was conducted using R statistical software. RESULTS We observed an overall decrease in respiratory HAVI of 68%, with pre-pandemic rates of 0.19 infections per 1000 patient significantly decreased to a rate of 0.06 per 1000 patient days in the pandemic period (P<0.01). Rhinovirus made up proportionally more of our respiratory HAVI in the pandemic period (64% vs 53%), with respiratory HAVI secondary only to rhinovirus identified during 8 of 16 months in the pandemic period. Compliance with our HAVI prevention bundle significantly improved during pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS Enhancement of our HAVI bundle during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed toward significant reduction in nosocomial transmission of respiratory HAVI. Even with prevention practices optimized, respiratory HAVIs secondary to rhinovirus continued to be reported, likely due to the capacity of rhinovirus to evade bundle elements in hospital, and infection prevention efforts at large in the community, leaving vulnerable patients at continued risk.",2022-05-16,American journal of infection control,"Kitt, Eimear; Brennan, Lauren; Harrison, Cecelia; Hei, Hillary; Paul, Elina; Satchell, Lauren; Wilson, Kimberly; Smathers, Sarah; Handy, Lori; Coffin, Susan E"
ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin system.,"In 2020 we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) discovery. This event was a landmark that shaped the way that we see the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) today. ACE2 is an important molecular hub that connects the RAS classical arm, formed mainly by the octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) and its receptor AT1, with the RAS alternative or protective arm, formed mainly by the heptapeptides Ang-(1-7) and alamandine, and their receptors, Mas and MrgD, respectively. In this work we reviewed classical and modern literature to describe how ACE2 is a critical component of the protective arm, particularly in the context of the cardiac function, coagulation homeostasis and immune system. We also review recent literature to present a critical view of the role of ACE2 and RAS in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",2020-12-11,Clinical science,"Verano-Braga, Thiago; Martins, Ana Luiza Valle; Motta-Santos, Daisy; Campagnole-Santos, Maria José; Santos, Robson Augusto Souza"
Presenting porous-organic-polymers as next-generation invigorating materials for nanoreactors.,"Porous organic polymers (POPs) represent an emerging class of porous organic materials which mainly comprise organic building blocks that are interconnected via strong covalent bonds, thereby offering highly cross-linked frameworks with rigid structures and specific void spaces for accommodating guest molecules. In the past few years, POPs have garnered colossal research interest as nanoreactors for heterogeneous catalysis (thermal, photochemical, electrochemical, etc.) because of their intriguing characteristic features, such as high thermal and chemical stabilities, adjustable chemical functionalities, large surface areas, and tunable pore size distributions. This feature article provides an overview of existing research relating to diverse POP synthetic approaches (COFs, CTFs, and some amorphous POPs), the possible modification of the functionality of POPs, and their exciting application as next-generation nanoreactors. These POPs are extremely interesting, as they offer the potential for either metal-free or metalated polymer catalysts allowing photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar-fuel, biofuel upgrades, the conversion of waste cooking oil to bio-oil, and clean H2 production from water, addressing many scientific and technological challenges and providing new opportunities for various specific topics in catalysis. Finally, we emphasize that the integration of various synthetic approaches and the application of POPs as nanoreactors will provide opportunities in the near future for the precision synthesis of functional materials with significant impact in both basic and applied research areas.",2021-08-09,Chemical communications,"Sarkar, Chitra; Shit, Subhash Chandra; Das, Nitumani; Mondal, John"
COVID-19 screening test by using random oropharyngeal saliva,"An optimal clinical specimen for accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by minimizing the usage of consumables and reduce hazard exposure to healthcare workers is an urgent priority. The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p < .05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4). The Ct values of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP + OP swabs specimens.

A comparison of bats and rodents as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses: are bats special?,"Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.",2013,Proceedings.

Understanding the Chinese-Speaking Economies,"The term ‘Greater China’ is defined in this chapter as one which includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

DEA allows buprenorphine inductions based on telephone only,"Last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA)–waived prescribers can treat new patients with buprenorphine based on a telephone call only. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enforced by the DEA, requires all new patients being treated with controlled substances to have an in‐person — or, for now, telemedicine — physical exam. Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID‐19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take‐home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID‐19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).",2020-04-03,,"Knopf, Alison"

How Do Social Structures Become Taken for Granted? Social Reproduction in Calm and Crisis,"This paper identifies experiential processes through which social structures become taken for granted, termed processes of “structure marginalization”. Passive processes of structure marginalization relegate social structures to the margin of experience without the use of higher-order cognitive acts such as evaluation and reflection. Examples include adapting to social structures via routine and habitual practices (material reification), a lack of conscious awareness of the complexity, historical formation, and other details of social structures (ignorance), and rendering social structures irrelevant when they are unreflectively judged to be of no value for achieving ends (nullification). Active processes of structure marginalization reflectively and discursively relegate social structures to marginal consciousness. Examples include the use of naturalistic and necessitarian explanations for the social order that implicitly justify it as inalterable or “just the way things are” (discursive reification), normative justifications for the status quo (legitimation), and conscious awareness of one’s powerlessness to control social-structural conditions (helplessness). Active processes of structure marginalization originate in passive processes. The goal of the typology is to explain, at the level of experience, why social structures typically remain unproblematic and unnoticed in everyday life, even during periods of social crisis and change or when existing structures produce harmful effects.",2021-07-06,Hum Stud,"Gunderson, Ryan"
"Factors Affecting Public Non-compliance With Large-scale Social Restrictions to Control COVID-19 Transmission in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia","OBJECTIVES: The Indonesian government issued large-scale social restrictions (called Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar, or PSBB) at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to control the spread of COVID-19 in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi (Greater Jakarta). Public compliance poses a challenge when implementing large-scale social restrictions, and various factors have contributed to public non-compliance with the regulation. This study aimed to determine the degree of non-compliance and identify the factors that contributed to public non-compliance with the PSBB in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a quantitative study with a cross-sectional design. A total of 839 residents of Greater Jakarta participated in this study. Data were collected online using a Google Form, and convenience sampling was undertaken. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationships between public non-compliance with the PSBB regulation and socio-demographic variables, respondents’ opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. RESULTS: A total of 22.6% of subjects reported participating in activities that did not comply with the PSBB. The variables that most affected non-compliance with the PSBB were age, gender, income, opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening social capital and providing information about COVID-19 prevention measures, such as washing one’s hands with soap, wearing masks properly, and maintaining social distancing, is essential. Robust public understanding will foster trust and cooperation with regard to COVID-19 prevention efforts and provide a basis for mutual agreement regarding rules/penalties.",2021-06-24,J Prev Med Public Health,"Rosha, Bunga Christitha; Suryaputri, Indri Yunita; Irawan, Irlina Raswanti; Arfines, Prisca Petty; Triwinarto, Agus"
The most recent advances in understanding and managing hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, and debilitating skin disease of the hair follicle unit that typically develops after puberty. HS has a significant negative impact on both the quality of life (QOL) of patients affected by this disease as well as family members and caregivers. However, the pathogenesis of HS is multifactorial and still remains to be fully elucidated, which makes the development of treatments difficult. The last 10 years have seen a surge in HS research, and many new findings have come to light, yet much more remains to be elucidated. Physicians must employ a multidisciplinary approach to maximally address all facets of HS. Clinical characteristics of the disease that differ between females and males as well as across different races and ethnic groups must be considered. Targeted topical, oral, and injectable therapies continue to be developed for HS as a greater understanding of the pathogenesis is reached. However, randomized controlled trials regarding dietary factors that may contribute to HS are needed to meet our patients’ growing concerns and questions about the role of diet in HS pathogenesis. Finally, improved outcome measures are needed to standardize HS severity and grading between physicians and clinical trials, and a more diverse representation of HS populations is needed in clinical trials.",2020-08-26,F1000Res,"Narla, Shanthi; Lyons, Alexis B.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H."
Glycosylation is a key in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 causes the respiratory syndrome COVID-19 and is responsible for the current pandemic. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2-mediating virus binding to target cells and subsequent viral uptake is extensively glycosylated. Here we focus on how glycosylation of both SARS-CoV-2 and target cells crucially impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels: (1) virus binding and entry to host cells, with glycosaminoglycans of host cells acting as a necessary co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by interacting with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, (2) innate and adaptive immune response where glycosylation plays both a protective role and contributes to immune evasion by masking of viral polypeptide epitopes and may add to the cytokine cascade via non-fucosylated IgG, and (3) therapy and vaccination where a monoclonal antibody-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 was shown to interact also with a distinct glycan epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These evidences highlight the importance of ensuring that glycans are considered when tackling this disease, particularly in the development of vaccines, therapeutic strategies and serological testing.",2021,J Mol Med (Berl),"Reis, Celso A; Tauber, Rudolf; Blanchard, Véronique"
Whom Should Be Saved? A Proposed Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Medical Resources to COVID-19 Patients Using Fuzzy Logic,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that affected the everyday life activities of billions around the world. It is an unprecedented crisis that the modern world had never experienced before. It mainly affected the economic state and the health care system. The rapid and increasing number of infected patients overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure, which causes high demand and, thus, shortage in the required staff members and medical resources. This shortage necessitates practical and ethical suggestions to guide clinicians and medical centers when allocating and reallocating scarce resources for and between COVID-19 patients. Many studies proposed a set of ethical principles that should be applied and implemented to address this problem. In this study, five different ethical principles based on the most commonly recommended principles and aligned with WHO guidelines and state-of-the-art practices proposed in the literature were identified, and recommendations for their applications were discussed. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted physicians' propensity to apply a combination of more than one ethical principle while prioritizing the medical resource allocation. Based on that, an ethical framework that is based on Fuzzy inference systems was proposed. The proposed framework's input is the identified ethical principles, and the output is a weighted value (per patient). This value can be used as a rank or a priority factor given to the patients based on their condition and other relevant information, like the severity of their disease status. The main idea of implementing fuzzy logic in the framework is to combine more than one principle when calculating the weighted value, hence mimicking what some physicians apply in practice. Moreover, the framework's rules are aligned with the identified ethical principles. This framework can help clinicians and guide them while making critical decisions to allocate/reallocate the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis and future similar pandemics.",2021-03-22,Front Med (Lausanne),"Saadeh, Heba; Saadeh, Maha; Almobaideen, Wesam"
Repositioning gastroenterology services during covid-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: In COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals become overwhelmed with acute admissions leading to the suspension of outpatient clinics including gastroenterology and endoscopic services Similarly available resources are channeled to combat the scourge These diversions of resources coupled with lockdowns and fear of getting infected prevent patients from accessing routine and lifesaving gastroenterology services leading to increased gastrointestinal-related morbidity and mortality in at-risk populations Often, there are delays in the diagnosis and early treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, and high risks of death from gastrointestinal bleeding SUMMARY: This review discusses COVID-19 risk factors and ways and means of ensuring safe essential gastroenterology services in the setting of COVID-19 pandemic based on available evidence Telemedicine avoids physical contacts, maximizes safety by reducing the risk of infection to both clinicians and patients, and is conducive to a lockdown, quarantine, or self-isolation environment of COVID-19 It can be used to triage critical cases requiring life-saving endoscopic procedures The review also explores measures at derisking endoscopies being high-risk aerosol generating procedures The emerging technology of non-contact endoscopy in the form of robotic endoscopy raises hope in this direction",2020,Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Research,"Yakubu, I.

Endocrine and metabolic aspects of COVID-19,"The paper presents the theoretical considerations on the role of endocrine and metabolic alterations accompanying COVID-19 infection. These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.",2021,Endokrynol Pol,"Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna"

Programmable System of Cas13-Mediated RNA Modification and Its Biological and Biomedical Applications,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas13 has drawn broad interest to control gene expression and cell fate at the RNA level in general. Apart from RNA interference mediated by its endonuclease activity, the nuclease-deactivated form of Cas13 further provides a versatile RNA-guided RNA-targeting platform for manipulating kinds of RNA modifications post-transcriptionally. Chemical modifications modulate various aspects of RNA fate, including translation efficiency, alternative splicing, RNA–protein affinity, RNA–RNA interaction, RNA stability and RNA translocation, which ultimately orchestrate cellular biologic activities. This review summarizes the history of the CRISPR-Cas13 system, fundamental components of RNA modifications and the related physiological and pathological functions. We focus on the development of epi-transcriptional editing toolkits based on catalytically inactive Cas13, including RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR) and xABE (adenosine base editor) for adenosine deamination, RNA Editing for Specific C-to-U Exchange (RESCUE) and xCBE (cytidine base editor) for cytidine deamination and dm(6)ACRISPR, as well as the targeted RNA methylation (TRM) and photoactivatable RNA m(6)A editing system using CRISPR-dCas13 (PAMEC) for m(6)A editing. We further highlight the emerging applications of these useful toolkits in cell biology, disease and imaging. Finally, we discuss the potential limitations, such as off-target editing, low editing efficiency and limitation for AAV delivery, and provide possible optimization strategies.",2021-07-27,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Tang, Tian; Han, Yingli; Wang, Yuran; Huang, He; Qian, Pengxu"

The results showed that environmental learning was carried out to children through miniatures or animal sculptures in the classroom then taking school children to the zoo to get to know the animals. When the teacher was in class he asked again what he had seen in nature. The teacher also takes school children to nature to see the plants and animals in the surrounding environment. Meanwhile to hone the social session the teacher makes various games such as role-playing games to become a police officer so that there is cooperation between students. Then the teacher also uses outdoor games such as swings where there is social learning because they have to be done together. Another way is to play the role of a policeman and some other students play the role of criminals.

"Human Bocavirus in Brazil: Molecular Epidemiology, Viral Load and Co-Infections","Human bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus and has been detected worldwide, especially in pediatric patients with respiratory and gastrointestinal infection. In this study, we describe HBoV prevalence, genotypes circulation and DNA shedding, in stool samples from children up to two years of age in Brazil. During 2016 and 2017, 886 acute gastroenteritis (AGE) stool samples from ten Brazilian states were analyzed by TaqMan(®)-based qPCR, to detect and quantify HBoV. Positive samples were genotyped by sequencing the VP1/2 overlap region, followed by phylogenetic analysis and co-infections were accessed by screening other gastroenteric viruses. HBoV was detected in 12.4% (n = 110) of samples, with viral load ranging from 1.6 × 10(2) to 1.2 × 10(9) genome copies per gram of stool. From these, co-infections were found in 79.1%, and a statistically lower HBoV viral load was found compared to viral loads of rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus in double infected patients (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between HBoV viral load in single or co-infections, age groups or genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis identified the circulation of HBoV-1 in 38%, HBoV-2 in 40% and HBoV-3 in 22%. Continuous HBoV monitoring is needed to clarify its role in diarrhea disease, especially in the absence of classic gastroenteric viruses.",2020-08-10,Pathogens,"Malta, Fábio Correia; Varella, Rafael Brandão; Guimarães, Maria Angelica Arpon Marandino; Miagostovich, Marize Pereira; Fumian, Tulio Machado"
Adaptive Aggregation For Federated Learning,"Advances in federated learning (FL) algorithms,along with technologies like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, have led to FL being increasingly adopted and used in many application domains. This increasing adoption has led to rapid growth in the number, size (number of participants/parties) and diversity (intermittent vs. active parties) of FL jobs. Many existing FL systems, based on centralized (often single) model aggregators are unable to scale to handle large FL jobs and adapt to parties' behavior. In this paper, we present a new scalable and adaptive architecture for FL aggregation. First, we demonstrate how traditional tree overlay based aggregation techniques (from P2P, publish-subscribe and stream processing research) can help FL aggregation scale, but are ineffective from a resource utilization and cost standpoint. Next, we present the design and implementation of AdaFed, which uses serverless/cloud functions to adaptively scale aggregation in a resource efficient and fault tolerant manner. We describe how AdaFed enables FL aggregation to be dynamically deployed only when necessary, elastically scaled to handle participant joins/leaves and is fault tolerant with minimal effort required on the (aggregation) programmer side. We also demonstrate that our prototype based on Ray scales to thousands of participants, and is able to achieve a>90% reduction in resource requirements and cost, with minimal impact on aggregation latency.",2022-03-23,,"Jayaram, K.

Effect of high-quality nursing on postpartum hemorrhage and quality of life in puerperants with gestational hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of high-quality nursing on puerperants with gestational hypertension. METHODS: In this study, 144 puerperants with gestational hypertension admitted to our hospital were included and divided into a research group and a control group according to the nursing method. The control group (n = 72) adopted the routine nursing and the observation group (n = 72) adopted the high-quality nursing. The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage, the quality of life (QOL), the psychological states, and the nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, and the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage of the patients in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). After intervention, the scores of psychological states in both groups decreased, which dropped more in the observation group (all P < 0.05). The scores of physical function, overall health, social function, and emotional role in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). The patients' satisfaction on nursing in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-quality nursing has certain advantages in improving postpartum hemorrhage and QOL in puerperants with gestational hypertension.

Bradycardia in Patients With COVID-19: A Calm Before the Storm?,"Cardiac manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), including arrhythmia, have been described in the literature. However, to our knowledge, association of COVID-19 with bradycardia has not been reported. This case study describes sinus bradycardia as a potential manifestation of COVID-19. This is a retrospective case series of four patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to St. Luke’s University Health Network ICU between 24 March 2020 and 5 April 2020. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients’ bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.",2020-06-13,Cureus,"Amaratunga, Eluwana A; Corwin, Douglas S; Moran, Lynn; Snyder, Richard"
The impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the short‐term survival of patients with cancer in Northern Portugal,"The COVID‐19 pandemic led to potential delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients, which may negatively affect the prognosis of these patients. Our study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID‐19 on the short‐term survival of cancer patients by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. All cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin‐melanoma, breast, cervix, and prostate, from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO‐Porto) and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July of 2019 (before COVID‐19) and 2020 (after COVID‐19) were identified. Information regarding sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were collected from the cancer registry database and clinical files. Vital status was assessed to 31 October of the respective years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate crude and propensity score‐adjusted hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of death. During follow‐up to 31 October, there were 154 (11.8%) deaths observed before COVID‐19 and 131 (17.2%) after COVID‐19, corresponding to crude and adjusted HRs (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.20‐1.91) and 1.10 (0.86‐1.40), respectively. Significantly higher adjusted hazards of death were observed for patients with Stage III cancer (HR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.14‐4.94) and those undergoing surgical treatment (HR = 3.97; 95% CI: 1.14‐13.77) or receiving radiotherapy (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.96‐3.74), while patients who did not receive any treatment had a lower mortality hazards (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46‐0.83). The higher overall short‐term mortality observed during the COVID‐19 pandemic largely reflects the effects of the epidemic on the case‐mix of patients being diagnosed with cancer.",2021-03-13,Int J Cancer,"Morais, Samantha; Antunes, Luís; Rodrigues, Jéssica; Fontes, Filipa; Bento, Maria José; Lunet, Nuno"
"Incentives, lockdown, and testing: from Thucydides’ analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic","In this work, we provide a general mathematical formalism to study the optimal control of an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, via incentives to lockdown and testing. In particular, we model the interplay between the government and the population as a principal–agent problem with moral hazard, à la Cvitanić et al. (Finance Stoch 22(1):1–37, 2018), while an epidemic is spreading according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as proposed respectively by Gray et al. (SIAM J Appl Math 71(3):876–902, 2011) and Tornatore et al. (Phys A Stat Mech Appl 354(15):111–126, 2005). More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing interactions between individuals. However, this effort—which cannot be perfectly monitored by the government—comes at social and monetary cost for the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government’s optimisation problems then boils down to solving an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.",2022-04-10,J Math Biol,"Hubert, Emma; Mastrolia, Thibaut; Possamaï, Dylan; Warin, Xavier"
Conducting multiple mini-interviews in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic,"Multiple mini-interview (MMI) is a 'multiple sample-based' approach comprising multiple focused encounters intended to access and assess a range of attributes in order to gain more objectively multiple impressions of an applicant's interpersonal skills, thoughtfulness and general demeanour. It is designed to focus on four domains that are not considered to be comprehensive, but are considered to be vital for a successful career in the health sciences: critical thinking, ethical decision making, communication and knowledge of the healthcare system. Traditionally, the MMI is conducted face-to-face, but with COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of social distancing measures, no onsite or campus teaching, banning of mass gatherings and cancellation of face-to-face interviews, Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'adatul Bolkiah Institute of Health Sciences at Universiti Brunei Darussalam explored the feasibility of conducting MMI through virtual means. This report provides an account of our experience in conducting internet-MMI for the selection of new applicants into the August 2020 cohort of the Medicine programme. We also aimed to determine whether the scores derived from internet-MMI were reliable and equivalent to the scores derived from traditional MMI.",2021,Med Educ Online,"Kok, Kenneth Yy; Chen, Lie; Idris, Fazean Irdayati; Mumin, Nuramalina H; Ghani, Hazim; Zulkipli, Ihsan Nazurah; Lim, Mei Ann"
777 Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic,"AIMS: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the preferred revascularization strategy among patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region. Deidentified ECGs were analysed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration ≥40 ms and/or depth ≥25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). From 21 February 2020 to 16 April 2020, a total of 3239 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded, and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type, and location of STEMI (Table 1). Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 21.2–43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9; P < 0.001). These findings remained similar when QS- and qR complexes were analysed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, one out of two patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-12-08,Eur Heart J Suppl,"Leone, Attilio; Avvedimento, Marisa; Angellotti, Domenico; Simonetti, Fiorenzo; Iapicca, Cristina; Verde, Nicola; Manzi, Lina; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Spinelli, Alessandra; Franzone, Anna; Piccolo, Raffaele; Esposito, Giovanni"
COVID-19 and Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review,"Background: Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) due to myocytes involvement are among the leading causes of sudden adolescent death and heart failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there are limited data available on cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19, leading to severe outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in Pubmed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to August 2020, for all relevant studies about COVID-19 and CMPs. Results: A total of 29 articles with a total number of 1460 patients were included. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and ischemic heart disease were the most reported comorbidities among patients with COVID-19 and cardiomyopathy. In the laboratory findings, 21.47% of patients had increased levels of troponin. Raised D-dimer levels were also reported in all of the patients. Echocardiographic results revealed mild, moderate, and severe Left Ventricular (LV) dysfunction present in 17.13, 11.87, and 10% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: Cardiac injury and CMPs were common conditions in patients with COVID-19.

"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 pandemic) in Nigeria: Multi-institutional survey of knowledge, practices and perception amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students","The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with an increasing public health concern. Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P &#8804; 0.05. The respondents' mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ± 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ± 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%). Being in the 6th year of study (OR = 3.18, 95%CI: 1.62-6.26, P = 0.001) and female (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.11-4.41, P = 0.024) were significant positive predictors of good knowledge and satisfactory practices, respectively. While only 30% of the respondents perceived the pandemic as a scam or a disease of the elites (24.0%), the respondents were worried about their academics being affected negatively (55.6%). Veterinary Medical Students in Nigeria had good knowledge and satisfactory preventive practices towards COVID-19; albeit with essential gaps in the key non-pharmaceutical preventive measures recommended by the WHO. Therefore, there is a need to step up enlightenment and targeted campaigns about COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,PLoS One,"Adebowale, Oluwawemimo Oluseun; Adenubi, Olubukola Tolulope; Adesokan, Hezekiah Kehinde; Oloye, Abimbola Adetokunbo; Bankole, Noah Olumide; Fadipe, Oladotun Ebenezer; Ayo-Ajayi, Patience Oluwatoyin; Akinloye, Adebayo Koyuum"
Transforming assessment in accounting education to align with online learning,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to provide insights into challenges and opportunities in transforming assessment of learning in accounting education from established practices to technology-based methods. 10;10;Design/methodology/approach This reflective commentary is based on personal reflections and experiences of three senior academics from the same university on the accelerated utilisation of online assessment in accounting education due to COVID-19. Further information was obtained from document analysis, informal conversations with colleagues and observations. Findings The findings of this paper suggest that despite numerous challenges, online assessments may replace traditional face-to-face assessments such as tests and exams in accounting and if done properly, this could drive significant improvements in student learning and outcomes. Institutions need to invest in appropriate technology, provide appropriate staff training and ensure good online assessment design that incorporates principles of authenticity and fairness. Robust online assessment practices need to be integrated with e-proctoring systems to ensure academic integrity is upheld. Practical implications The paper provides functional insights to higher education management, teaching staff and other stakeholders such as professional accreditation bodies on challenges and opportunities in utilising online assessments. It offers guidance to educators on transforming assessment of learning using the power of technology. Originality/value The ideas in this paper are original.

Resilience of the Romanian Independent Cultural Sector under COVID-19 Pandemic Using the Grounded Theory,"In the event of any crisis, such as, in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic, new challenges arise, ranging from social and environmental phenomena to economic issues. One of the most affected economic sectors was the cultural one, especially independent artists, whose financial stability is usually inconsistent. The aim of this article was to test the immediate reactions of the cultural sector, both public and private, to the pandemic shock and, implicitly, to the restrictions imposed during the state of emergency in Romania (27 February–14 May 2020). By using grounded theory, 36 public documents of cultural stakeholders were coded and analyzed. All documents were identified in the Romanian online environment during the state of emergency. Based on the identified interrelationships, it was found that the independent contractors, self-employed workers in the creative-cultural sector, whether or not associated with NGOs or employees of public institutions, need financial and community support. However, the resilience of the cultural sector is conditioned by the creation of new multi-level policies for crisis management.",2022,Sustainability,"Marian-Potra, Alexandra-Camelia Pop Ana-Maria Hognogi Gheorghe-Gavrilă Nagy Júlia A."
Identification of key proteins in the signaling crossroads between wound healing and cancer hallmark phenotypes,"Wound healing (WH) and cancer seem to share common cellular and molecular processes that could work in a tight balance to maintain tissue homeostasis or, when unregulated, drive tumor progression. The “Cancer Hallmarks” comprise crucial biological properties that mediate the advancement of the disease and affect patient prognosis. These hallmarks have been proposed to overlap with essential features of the WH process. However, common hallmarks and proteins actively participating in both processes have yet to be described. In this work we identify 21 WH proteins strongly linked with solid tumors by integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer and multi-omics analyses. These proteins were associated with eight of the ten described cancer hallmarks, especially avoiding immune destruction. These results show that WH and cancer's common proteins are involved in the microenvironment modification of solid tissues and immune system regulation. This set of proteins, between WH and cancer, could represent key targets for developing therapies.",2021-08-26,Sci Rep,"López-Cortés, Andrés; Abarca, Estefanía; Silva, Leonardo; Velastegui, Erick; León-Sosa, Ariana; Karolys, Germania; Cabrera, Francisco; Caicedo, Andrés"

Impact of lockdown on patients with congestive heart failure during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"AIMS: Cardiovascular co‐morbidities like congestive heart failure (CHF) alter the course of coronavirus disease 2019. Factors associated with the outbreak and lockdown can exacerbate CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the answers of 124 randomly selected CHF outpatients (mean age 71.0 ± 14.0 years, 60.5% male) interviewed by phone during the sixth and seventh weeks of the lockdown. Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score ≥ 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n = 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P = 0.025) and urban dwellers (P = 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%. Increase in HF symptoms was commonly reported (21.8%) and tended to be higher in women than in men (P = 0.074). Of the 23 patients who had a phone teleconsultation during the pandemic, 16 had initially planned an in‐person consultation that they switched for teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, psychological distress and decreased well‐being were common in CHF outpatients, and there was an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. These changes may negatively impact short‐term and long‐term prognoses.

Incidental COVID-19 in a heart-kidney transplant recipient with malnutrition and recurrent infections: Implications for the SARS-CoV-2 immune response,"The clinical course and outcomes of immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients, with COVID-19 remain unclear. It has been postulated that a substantial portion of the disease burden seems to be mediated by the host immune activation to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we present a simultaneous heart-kidney transplant (SHKT) recipient who was hospitalized for the management of respiratory failure from volume overload complicated by failure to thrive, multiple opportunistic infections, and open non-healing wounds in the setting of worsening renal dysfunction weeks prior to the first case of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in the state of Connecticut. After his third endotracheal intubation, routine nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2, in anticipation of a planned tracheostomy, was positive. His hemodynamics, respiratory status, and ventilator requirements remained stable without any worsening for 4 weeks until he had a negative NAT test. It is possible that the immunocompromised status of our patient may have prevented significant immune activation leading up to clinically significant cytokine storm that could have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure.",2020,Transpl Infect Dis,"Serrano, Oscar K; Kutzler, Heather L; Rochon, Caroline; Radojevic, Joseph A; Lawlor, Michael T; Hammond, Jonathan A; Gluck, Jason; Feingold, Andrew D; Jaiswal, Abhishek"
A novel viral protein translation mechanism reveals mitochondria as a target for antiviral drug development,"The ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has acutely highlighted the need to identify new treatment strategies for viral infections. Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5’ leader and 3’UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication. This study identifies an unreported viral protein translation mechanism and opens up a novel avenue for developing antiviral drugs.

PreDicta chip-based high resolution diagnosis of rhinovirus-induced wheeze,"Rhinovirus (RV) infections are major triggers of acute exacerbations of severe respiratory diseases such as pre-school wheeze, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The occurrence of numerous RV types is a major challenge for the identification of the culprit virus types and for the improvement of virus type-specific treatment strategies. Here, we develop a chip containing 130 different micro-arrayed RV proteins and peptides and demonstrate in a cohort of 120 pre-school children, most of whom had been hospitalized due to acute wheeze, that it is possible to determine the culprit RV species with a minute blood sample by serology. Importantly, we identify RV-A and RV-C species as giving rise to most severe respiratory symptoms. Thus, we have generated a chip for the serological identification of RV-induced respiratory illness which should be useful for the rational development of preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting the most important RV types.",2018-06-18,Nat Commun,"Niespodziana, Katarzyna; Stenberg-Hammar, Katarina; Megremis, Spyridon; Cabauatan, Clarissa R.; Napora-Wijata, Kamila; Vacal, Phyllis C.; Gallerano, Daniela; Lupinek, Christian; Ebner, Daniel; Schlederer, Thomas; Harwanegg, Christian; Söderhäll, Cilla; van Hage, Marianne; Hedlin, Gunilla; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Valenta, Rudolf"
Umami: an alternative Japanese approach to reducing sodium while enhancing taste desirability,"COVID-19 has highlighted the underlying global burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the lack of resiliency in health systems to tackle highly preventable risk factors, which have left populations vulnerable to acute health crises. The persistent issue of unhealthy behaviors, particularly those related to a high-sodium diet, suggests inadequate policy attention and insufficient funding for public health and behavioral research. This year, Japan will host the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit 2021. The summit is being held in the era of COVID-19, offering a historic opportunity to make a difference on the global health agenda for food and nutrition and to reaffirm the global commitment to prevent future health crises by addressing the growing burden of NCDs and building better prepared and more resilient health systems. This perspective article suggests that we, global health researchers and decision-makers, should rethink the value of using ""Umami"" substances as candidates for a practical salt-reducing alternative that originated in Japan (while maintaining the affordability, accessibility, availability, and desirability of healthy food). Reduced salt intake will help address the global syndemic of COVID-19 pandemic and high rates of hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, and other NCDs.

Pulse of the Pandemic: Iterative Topic Filtering for Clinical Information Extraction from Social Media,"The rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to quickly disseminate the latest clinical knowledge during a public-health emergency. One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the""#medtwitter""community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis. Our method can aid in future public-health emergencies by facilitating knowledge transfer among healthcare workers in a rapidly-changing information environment, and by providing an efficient and unsupervised way of highlighting potential areas for clinical research.",2021-02-13,,"Wu, Julia; Sivaraman, Venkatesh; Kumar, Dheekshita; Banda, Juan M.; Sontag, David"

Medical interns’ reflections on their training in use of personal protective equipment,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential, to prevent the acquisition and transmission of infectious diseases, yet its use is often sub-optimal in the clinical setting. Training and education are important to ensure and sustain the safe and effective use of PPE by medical interns, but current methods are often inadequate in providing the relevant knowledge and skills. The purpose of this study was to explore medical graduates’ experiences of the use of PPE and identify opportunities for improvement in education and training programmes, to improve occupational and patient safety. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2018 in a large tertiary-care teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, to explore medical interns’ self-reported experiences of PPE use, at the beginning of their internship. Reflexive groups were conducted immediately after theoretical and practical PPE training, during hospital orientation. Transcripts of recorded discussions were analysed, using a thematic approach that drew on the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) framework for behaviour. RESULTS: 80% of 90 eligible graduates participated. Many interns had not previously received formal training in the specific skills required for optimal PPE use and had developed potentially unsafe habits. Their experiences as medical students in clinical areas contrasted sharply with recommended practice taught at hospital orientation and impacted on their ability to cultivate correct PPE use. CONCLUSIONS: Undergraduate teaching should be consistent with best practice PPE use, and include practical training that embeds correct and safe practices.",2020-09-23,BMC Med Educ,"Barratt, Ruth; Wyer, Mary; Hor, Su-yin; Gilbert, Gwendolyn L."
Influence of prior and visual information on eye movements in amblyopic children.,"This study analyzed the characteristics of pursuit and assessed the influence of prior and visual information on eye velocity and saccades in amblyopic and control children, in comparison to adults. Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target.

Current Recommendations on Returning to Youth Sports After COVID-19 Infection,"Children represent a small fraction of total cumulative cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The potential health consequences related to infection for children are not inconsequential. For example, some may develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which is commonly associated with cardiovascular involvement. Nevertheless, the short- and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unknown. In particular, the impact on physical health and how it affects one's ability to return to physical activity are continuously evolving. As more youth sports organizations are lifting restrictions, the volume of youth athletes will increase and the demand for providing medical clearance will grow. This article aims to provide a review of return to physical activity guidelines for young athletes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection based on expert consensus statements and professional organization recommendations.

What Happened to Patients With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Multicentre Report From Tertiary Clinics in Northern Italy,"After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.",2020,Front.

"Chapter 4.4 - New millennium, new directions: 2000–2020","The new millennium brought momentous changes to the poison control movement. Poison Control Centers (PCCs) now provided services covering almost 100% of the US population. Federal funding helped to stabilize PCCs. The provision of a nationwide toll-free telephone number was key to forming a more cohesive network. Expanded public health roles for the PCC network included real-time poisoning surveillance and disaster preparedness. More effective educational outreach was possible via entry into the “virtual” community of social media websites. A number of advances changed PCC operations and education in clinical toxicology: enhanced Internet connectivity and bandwidth, the advent of artificial intelligence and simulation tools, advanced telecommunications, and the proliferation of smartphones.

Mitoquinone mesylate targets SARS-CoV-2 and associated lung inflammation through host pathways,"To date, there is no effective oral antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that is also anti-inflammatory. Herein, we show that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES), a dietary supplement, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. Mito-MES had nanomolar in vitro antiviral potency against the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mito-MES given in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice through oral gavage reduced viral titer by nearly 4 log units relative to the vehicle group. We found in vitro that the antiviral effect of Mito-MES is attributable to its hydrophobic dTPP+ moiety and its combined effects scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating Nrf2 and increasing the host defense proteins TOM70 and MX1. Mito-MES was efficacious reducing increase in cleaved caspase-3 and inflammation induced by SARS-CoV2 infection both in lung epithelial cells and a transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Mito-MES reduced production of IL-6 by SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells through its antioxidant properties (Nrf2 agonist, coenzyme Q10 moiety) and the dTPP moiety. Given established safety of Mito-MES in humans, our results suggest that Mito-MES may represent a rapidly applicable therapeutic strategy that can be added in the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19. Its potential long-term use by humans as diet supplement could help control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in the setting of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may compromise vaccine efficacy.

Impact of a clinical pharmacist on ultrasound-guided venous thromboembolism screening in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a pilot prospective study,"BACKGROUND: The recognition, prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a major challenge in the face of the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has been associated with significant cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and hematologic complications related to hypercoagulability. There has been little literature thus far on the utility of screening ultrasound and the role of the clinical pharmacist in treating these patients. METHODS: We present a prospective pilot program of thirty-one consecutive COVID-19 patients who were provided four extremity screening ultrasounds for VTE on admission. This was coordinated by a clinical pharmacist as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were recorded with the goal of describing the utility of the clinical pharmacist in ultrasound screening. Data collected include demographics, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during the hospitalization from each individual electronic medical record. RESULTS: Nine of the thirty-one patients presented with VTE. Of the nine patients, there were twenty-two total clotted vessels, all of which were asymptomatic. The clinical pharmacist, as the coordinator for a multidisciplinary COVID-19 associated coagulopathy management team, drafted a screening and treatment protocol for anticoagulation prophylaxis and therapy of VTE after ultrasound findings. CONCLUSION: VTE screening of hospitalized COVID-19 patients reveals a significant number of asymptomatic VTEs and justifies diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment measures coordinated by a clinical pharmacist.",2021-04-01,J Pharm Health Care Sci,"Gillespie, Laura; Khan, Rashid Z.; Stillson, John E.; Bunch, Connor M.; Shariff, Faisal Salim; Speybroeck, Jacob; Grisoli, Anne; Schmidt, Meredith Wierman; Phyu, Htay; Jablonski, Jason; Wells, Byars; Fulkerson, Daniel H.; Oancea, Lyndsay; Leiser, Abraham; Walsh, Mark"

Impact of diabetes in patients waiting for invasive cardiac procedures during COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, elective invasive cardiac procedures (ICP) have been frequently cancelled or postponed. Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Among patients in whom an elective invasive cardiac procedure is cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic, mortality and cardiovascular mortality is higher in patients with diabetes, irrespectively on other clinical conditions. These procedures should not be cancelled in patients with diabetes.",2021,Cardiovasc Diabetol,"Moreno, Raúl; Díez, José-Luis; Diarte, José-Antonio; Salinas, Pablo; de la Torre Hernández, José María; Andres-Cordón, Juan F; Trillo, Ramiro; Briales, Juan Alonso; Amat-Santos, Ignacio; Romaguera, Rafael; Díaz, José-Francisco; Vaquerizo, Beatriz; Ojeda, Soledad; Cruz-González, Ignacio; Morena-Salas, Daniel; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Sarnago, Fernando; Portero, Pilar; Gutierrez-Barrios, Alejandro; Alfonso, Fernando; Bosch, Eduard; Pinar, Eduardo; Ruiz-Arroyo, José-Ramón; Ruiz-Quevedo, Valeriano; Jiménez-Mazuecos, Jesús; Lozano, Fernando; Rumoroso, José-Ramón; Novo, Enrique; Irazusta, Francisco J; García Del Blanco, Bruno; Moreu, José; Ballesteros-Pradas, Sara M; Frutos, Araceli; Villa, Manuel; Alegría-Barrero, Eduardo; Lázaro, Rosa; Paredes, Emilio"
Probiotic use in an infectious disease setting.,"INTRODUCTION The lethality of infectious diseases and deep concern over growing antimicrobial resistance make it essential that alternative or adjunct therapies be developed. Areas covered: Using papers published in PubMed, a case is presented to consider beneficial microbes as a means to improve management of infectious diseases. Clinical evidence is mounting that certain probiotic microbes can contribute to this armamentarium. These could have an immediate effect against necrotizing enterocolitis, pre- and post-surgical procedures, antibiotic-associated infections, urogenital infections in women and for reducing the severity and duration of respiratory infections. While further studies will always be warranted irrespective of the intervention, and quality assurance and patient safety must remain a priority, the main barrier to implementation may well be unwarranted hesitation amongst physicians, healthcare administrators and regulators. Meanwhile, patients are already taking things into their own hands at a time when their knowledge of product selection is poor and clinical guidance is invariably missing. Expert commentary: Until vaccines and other alternatives emerge, it would be foolhardy to not use best practices to bring probiotics into mainstream infectious disease management. Our ability to manipulate microbial-host interactions offers hope before the last antibiotic stops being effective.",2017,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,"Reid, Gregor"

Compulsory medical intervention versus external constraint in pandemic control,"Would compulsory treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 be justified? In England, there would be significant legal barriers to it. However, we offer a conditional ethical argument in favour of allowing compulsory treatment and vaccination, drawing on an ethical comparison with external constraints-such as quarantine, isolation and 'lockdown'-that have already been authorised to control the pandemic in this jurisdiction. We argue that, if the permissive English approach to external constraints for COVID-19 has been justified, then there is a case for a similarly permissive approach to compulsory medical interventions.",2020,J. med. ethics,"Douglas, Thomas; Forsberg, Lisa; Pugh, Jonathan"

Social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections among people who inject drugs: protocol for a mixed studies systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: Injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections are a common complication among people who inject drugs (PWID), associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Invasive infections, including infective endocarditis, appear to be increasing in incidence. To date, preventive efforts have focused on modifying individual-level risk behaviours (eg, hand-washing and skin-cleaning) without much success in reducing the population-level impact of these infections. Learning from successes in HIV prevention, there may be great value in looking beyond individual-level risk behaviours to the social determinants of health. Specifically, the risk environment conceptual framework identifies how social, physical, economic and political environmental factors facilitate and constrain individual behaviour, and therefore influence health outcomes. Understanding the social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections could help to identify new targets for prevention efforts in the face of increasing incidence of severe disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a systematic review. We will review studies of PWID and investigate associations between risk factors (both individual-level and social/structural-level) and the incidence of hospitalisation or death due to injecting-related bacterial infections (skin and soft-tissue infections, bacteraemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, epidural abscess and others). We will include quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. Using directed content analysis, we will code risk factors for these infection-related outcomes according to their contributions to the risk environment in type (social, physical, economic or political) and level (microenvironmental or macroenvironmental). We will also code and present risk factors at each stage in the process of drug acquisition, preparation, injection, superficial infection care, severe infection care or hospitalisation, and outcomes after infection or hospital discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As an analysis of the published literature, no ethics approval is required. The findings will inform a research agenda to develop and implement social/structural interventions aimed at reducing the burden of disease.

A commentary of Messenger RNA vaccines in MIT Technology Review 2021,"One hundred years after the 1918 influenza pandemic, the world has seen another major outbreak on a global scale. This one is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. According to the World Health Organization, as of June 17, 2021, there have been 176,693,988 confirmed cases of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting in 3,830,304 deaths. Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent viral infection. During this pandemic, the speed at which the vaccine progressed from research and development to application was unprecedented. As of June 15, 2021, a total of 2,377,780,590 doses of various vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been administered worldwide. These vaccines included the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, which became famous upon their debut application in the real world and was listed as one of the ‘10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2021’ by MIT Technology Review. ① ① Original source in Chinese: H.

Contagion or interdependence? Comparing spillover indices,"We propose a novel risk measure that is built on comparing high-frequency time-varying volatility and low-frequency return spillover estimates. This measure permits to identify the markets that are epidemic in their complex interdependence. We conjecture that initially a highly volatile market experiences episodes of risk transmission, but only later absorbs risk and becomes an epidemic market. Moreover, we can detect newly emerging ‘contagion’ in the system. We examine the behaviour of 30 global equity markets and compare spillover measures, which encapsulate many large and small crises episodes. Instead of relying on ex post crisis information, our model identifies crises periods. An important implication of the proposed approach is that highly interrelated markets, such as China, are less likely to transmit a global economic crisis under the current interdependence setting.",2021-12-02,Empir Econ,"Islam, Raisul; Volkov, Vladimir"
"Developing a Sustainable and Circular Bio-Based Economy in EU: By Partnering Across Sectors, Upscaling and Using New Knowledge Faster, and For the Benefit of Climate, Environment & Biodiversity, and People & Business","This paper gives an overview of development of the EU-bioeconomy, 2014–2020. The Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014–2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE.

"Reliably quantifying the evolving worldwide dynamic state of the COVID-19 outbreak from death records, clinical parametrization, and demographic data","The dynamic characterization of the COVID-19 outbreak is critical to implement effective actions for its control and eradication but the information available at a global scale is not sufficiently reliable to be used directly. Here, we develop a quantitative approach to reliably quantify its temporal evolution and controllability through the integration of multiple data sources, including death records, clinical parametrization of the disease, and demographic data, and we explicitly apply it to countries worldwide, covering 97.4% of the human population, and to states within the United States (US). The validation of the approach shows that it can accurately reproduce the available prevalence data and that it can precisely infer the timing of nonpharmaceutical interventions. The results of the analysis identified general patterns of recession, stabilization, and resurgence. The diversity of dynamic behaviors of the outbreak across countries is paralleled by those of states and territories in the US, converging to remarkably similar global states in both cases. Our results offer precise insights into the dynamics of the outbreak and an efficient avenue for the estimation of the prevalence rates over time.",2021-10-07,Sci Rep,"Vilar, Jose M.

Resection of esophageal diverticulum through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.,"Open surgery remains the standard strategy for management of esophageal diverticulum in symptomatic patients. However, in the last years an increasing number of minimally invasive approaches have been proposed for this issue in order to reduce the surgical trauma and favor a fast return to daily activity. Herein, we describe a novel technique as uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for performing resection of esophageal diverticulum. This procedure was successfully carried out in three consecutive patients with giant mid-esophageal diverticulum (mean size: 6.5±0.5 cm). The mean post-operative time was 121±10 minutes. The chest drain was removed 48 hours later in all cases and the mean length of hospital stay was 9±1 days. No intraoperative neither postoperative complications were found in all patients but one. He had a small fistula 15 days later that was successfully treated with stent insertion. No recurrence of diverticulum was seen in all cases.

Stroke care during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: the experience of Spanish stroke units,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been heavily affected by COVID-19. Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak’s peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care. As a consequence, some patients with stroke did not receive adequate treatment.",2020-12-04,Stroke Vasc Neurol,"Alonso de Leciñana, María; Castellanos, Mar; Ayo-Martín, Óscar; Morales, Ana"
Should Firms Promote COVID-19 Vaccination to their Customers? Evidence of Social and Economic Impact from a Natural Experiment in Ridesharing (preprint),"By late 2021, only a fraction of the world’s population had been vaccinated for COVID-19. Governments and firms have invested billions of dollars to urge people to get vaccinated quickly so that economies can remain open. While public health experts have proposed several communication strategies to encourage vaccination, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of such campaigns, especially when undertaken by the private sector. Furthermore, firms may be hesitant to encourage their customers to vaccinate if they view such initiatives as a pro-social investment with no immediate positive effect on revenues. Using a natural experiment with a ridesharing platform, we find evidence that sharing information about vaccination can have a positive impact on both vaccination rates and firm revenues. Without providing financial incentives such as discounts or promotions, a simple ‘nudge’ can generate demand (trips) as well as motivate a socially beneficial action (getting vaccinated) by providing relevant and timely information (closest vaccine centers, appointment requirements, etc.). Analyzing more than four million customer trips, we found that providing COVID-19 vaccination information led to ~ 60% increase in trips to vaccine centers and an 7.67% increase in ridesharing usage among customers, generating 167 thousand dollars per week in additional revenues for the firm in the focal city. The increases in trips to vaccine centers and in revenues were likely driven by reduced search costs for customers and an increased number of trips taken by customers once fully vaccinated.",2021,,"Choudhary, Vivek Liu Zhaoyan Kireyev Pavel Turki Selim Borzdyko Olesya Boutaib Abderrahmane"
Atención de pacientes oftalmológicos durante la pandemia COVID-19: revisión panorámica rápida./ Atención de pacientes oftalmológicos durante la pandemia COVID-19: revisión panorámica rápida./ Care of ophthalmological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid scoping review,"Introduction: A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory distress syndrome that has been called COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented pandemic. Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.",2020,Medwave,"Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin"

"Megalocytivirus Induces Complicated Fish Immune Response at Multiple RNA Levels Involving mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA","Megalocytivirus is an important viral pathogen to many farmed fishes, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). In this study, we examined megalocytivirus-induced RNA responses in the spleen of flounder by high-throughput sequencing and integrative analysis of various RNA-seq data. A total of 1327 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 368 novel miRNAs, were identified, among which, 171 (named DEmiRs) exhibited significantly differential expressions during viral infection in a time-dependent manner. For these DEmiRs, 805 differentially expressed target mRNAs (DETmRs) were predicted, whose expressions not only significantly changed after megalocytivirus infection but were also negatively correlated with their paired DEmiRs. Integrative analysis of immune-related DETmRs and their target DEmiRs identified 12 hub DEmiRs, which, together with their corresponding DETmRs, formed an interaction network containing 84 pairs of DEmiR and DETmR. In addition to DETmRs, 19 DEmiRs were also found to regulate six key immune genes (mRNAs) differentially expressed during megalocytivirus infection, and together they formed a network consisting of 21 interactive miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairs. Further analysis identified 9434 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 169 of which (named DEcircRs) showed time-specific and significantly altered expressions during megalocytivirus infection. Integrated analysis of the DETmR-DEmiR and DEcircR-DEmiR interactions led to the identification of a group of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) constituted by interacting triplets of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA involved in antiviral immunity. Together these results indicate that complicated regulatory networks of different types of non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs are involved in megalocytivirus infection.",2021-03-19,Int J Mol Sci,"Wu, Qian; Ning, Xianhui; Sun, Li"

Targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteases as a therapeutic strategy to treat COVID-19,"The 21st century has witnessed three outbreaks of coronavirus (CoVs) infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly and since the discovery of the first COVID-19 infection in December 2019, has caused 1.2 million deaths worldwide and 226,777 deaths in the United States alone. The high amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins supports testing therapeutic molecules that were designed to treat SARS infections during the 2003 epidemic.

"Conversations in Times of Isolation: Exploring Rural-Dwelling Older Adults’ Experiences of Isolation and Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Manitoba, Canada","Older adults have been described as a vulnerable group in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, where this study took place, older adults have been encouraged to self-isolate while the rest of the population has been cautioned against in-person contact with them. Prior to COVID-19, social isolation and loneliness among older adults was considered a serious public health concern. Using a series of semi-structured interviews with 26 community-dwelling older adults (65+) living in rural Manitoba, we explore older adults’ experiences of isolation and loneliness in the initial stages of the pandemic between the months of May and July 2020. Participants identified a loss of autonomy, loss of activities and social spaces (e.g., having coffee or eating out, volunteering, and going to church), and lack of meaningful connection at home as factors influencing their sense of isolation and loneliness. Although these loses initially influenced participants’ self-reported isolation and loneliness, the majority developed strategies to mitigate isolation and loneliness, such as drawing on past experiences of isolation, engaging in physically distanced visits, connecting remotely, and “keeping busy.” Our findings call attention to the role of different environments and resources in supporting older adults social and emotional wellbeing, particularly as they adapt to changes in social contact over time.",2021-03-15,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Herron, Rachel V.; Newall, Nancy E.

Feasibility of a Saliva-Based COVID-19 Screening Program in Abu Dhabi Primary Schools: JCOM,"Objective: The pandemic has forced closures of primary schools, resulting in loss of learning time on a global scale. In addition to face coverings, social distancing, and hand hygiene, an efficient testing method is important to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in schools. We evaluated the feasibility of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing program among 18 primary schools in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Qualitative results show that children 4 to 5 years old had difficulty producing an adequate saliva specimen compared to those 6 to 12 years old. Methods: A short training video on saliva collection beforehand helps demystify the process for students and parents alike. Informed consent was challenging yet should be done beforehand by school health nurses or other medical professionals to reassure parents and maximize participation. Results: Telephone interviews with school administrators resulted in an 83% response rate. Overall, 93% of school administrators had a positive experience with saliva testing and felt the program improved the safety of their schools. The ongoing use of saliva testing for SARS-CoV-2 was supported by 73% of respondents.

Longitudinal monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using viral genetic markers and the estimation of unconfirmed COVID-19 cases,"In this study, wastewater-based surveillance was carried out to establish the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater and the incidence of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from clinical testing. The influent wastewater of three major water reclamation facilities (WRFs) in Northern Nevada, serving a population of 390,750, was monitored for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA gene markers, N1 and N2, from June 2020 through September 2021. A total of 614 samples were collected and analyzed. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater were observed to peak twice during the study period. A moderate correlation trend between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence data from clinical testing and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater was observed (Spearman r = 0.533). This correlation improved when using weekly average SARS-CoV-2 marker concentrations of wastewater and clinical case data (Spearman r = 0.790), presumably by mitigating the inherent variability of the environmental dataset and the effects of clinical testing artifacts (e.g., reporting lags). The research also demonstrated the value of wastewater-based surveillance as an early warning signal for early detection of trends in COVID-19 incidence. This was accomplished by identifying that the reported clinical cases had a stronger correlation to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring data when they were estimated to lag 7-days behind the wastewater data. The results aided local decision makers in developing strategies to manage COVID-19 in the region and provide a framework for how wastewater-based surveillance can be applied across localities to enhance the public health monitoring of the ongoing pandemic.",2022-04-15,Sci Total Environ,"Li, Lin; Mazurowski, Lauren; Dewan, Aimee; Carine, Madeline; Haak, Laura; Guarin, Tatiana C.; Dastjerdi, Niloufar Gharoon; Gerrity, Daniel; Mentzer, Casey; Pagilla, Krishna R."

"Ethnomedicinal herbs in African traditional medicine with potential activity for the prevention, treatment, and management of coronavirus disease 2019","BACKGROUND: Ethnomedicine, a study of traditional medicine, is significant in drug discovery and development. African traditional medicine has been in existence for several thousands of years, and several drugs have been discovered and developed from it. MAIN TEXT: The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has widely spread globally with high mortality and morbidity. Its prevention, treatment and management still pose a serious challenge. A drug for the cure of this disease is yet to be developed. The clinical management at present is based on symptomatic treatment as presented by individuals infected and this is by combination of more than two drugs such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and anti-microbials. Literature search was performed through electronic searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and several research reports including WHO technical documents and monographs. CONCLUSION: Drug discovery from herbs is essential and should be exploited for the discovery of drugs for the management of COVID-19.

Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk for mortality in elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVES: High-risk patients &#8805;65 y of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tended to have lower serum prealbumin concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of prealbumin at baseline on COVID-19-related mortality in elderly patients (&#8805;65 y of age). METHODS: We non-selectively and consecutively collected participants from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 17 to February 17, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcomes (in-hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and mechanical ventilation) in elderly patients with COVID-19. Linear trend was performed by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as a continuous variable and was visually confirmed by using generalized additive models. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: We included 446 elderly patients with COVID-19 in the final analyses. In-hospital mortality was 14.79%. Of the 446 patients, 15.47% were admitted to the ICU and 21.3% required mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients in the highest tertile, the prealbumin of patients in the lowest tertile had a 19.09-fold higher risk for death [odds ratio (OR), 20.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.62-111.64; P = 0.0006], 25.39-fold higher risk for ICU admission (OR, 26.39; 95% CI, 4.04-172.39; P = 0.0006), and 1.8-fold higher risk for mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.15-6.78; P = 0.0227) after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a linear trend correlation between serum prealbumin concentration and risk for in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Prealbumin is an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality for elderly patients with COVID-19. Assessment of prealbumin may help identify high-risk individuals &#8805;65 y of age with COVID-19.",2020,Nutrition,"Zuo, Peiyuan; Tong, Song; Yan, Qi; Cheng, Ling; Li, Yuanyuan; Song, Kaixin; Chen, Yuting; Dai, Yue; Gao, Hongyu; Zhang, Cuntai"

Forecasting patient arrivals at emergency department using calendar and meteorological information,"Overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a serious problem in many countries. Accurate ED patient arrival forecasts can serve as a management baseline to better allocate ED personnel and medical resources. We combined calendar and meteorological information and used ten modern machine learning methods to forecast patient arrivals. For daily patient arrival forecasting, two feature selection methods are proposed. One uses kernel principal component analysis(KPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of all of the features, and the other is to use the maximal information coefficient(MIC) method to select the features related to the daily data first and then perform KPCA dimensionality reduction. The current study focuses on a public hospital ED in Hefei, China. We used the data November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 for model training; and patient arrival data September 1, 2020 to November 31, 2020 for model validation. The results show that for hourly patient arrival forecasting, each machine learning model has better forecasting results than the traditional autoRegressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, especially long short-term memory (LSTM) model. For daily patient arrival forecasting, the feature selection method based on MIC-KPCA has a better forecasting effect, and the simpler models are better than the ensemble models. The method we proposed could be used for better planning of ED personnel resources.",2022-01-21,Appl Intell (Dordr),"Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Jie; Tao, Min; Shu, Jian; Zhu, Degang"
Convolutional neural network-based ambient light-independent panel digit surveillance technique for infusion pumps.,"For effective patient therapy and improved patient safety, it is critical to administer medication accurately in accordance with doctor's prescription. However, accidents owing to the erroneous programing of infusion pumps caused by users have been consistently reported in several documents. In this study, the authors propose a novel surveillance technique for infusion pumps to continuously monitor the variations in panel digits using a convolutional neural network model, and evaluate the performance of the implemented technique. During the experimental evaluation, 1st-step ROIs and 2nd-step ROIs were successfully extracted from the frame images regardless of the ambient lighting conditions. The final accuracies of the implemented CNN model are 99.9% for both the training (172,800 images) and validation (1080 images) dataset while the final losses for the training and validation datasets are 0.48 and 0.45 after 13th epoch, respectively. In the 24-h continuous monitoring test, the accuracy of the model for volume recognition considering all the 1440 measurements (960 for day-lighting and 480 for night-lighting) is 95.5%, whereas in day-lighting and night-lighting modes the accuracies of the model are 98.2% and 90.0%, respectively. Based on these experimental results, the proposed surveillance technique incorporating infusion pumps is expected to improve the safety of patients who need long-term treatments via infusion pumps, reducing the burden on the nurses and hospitals.",2021-02-21,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

DCcov: Repositioning of Drugs and Drug Combinations for SARS-CoV-2 Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g., predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Other drugs like gemcitabine, rosuvastatin and acetylcysteine, and drug combinations like azathioprine-pemetrexed might offer new chances for treating COVID-19.",2021,,"Kishk, Ali Pacheco Maria Pires Sauter Thomas"

Saving lives by ventilating two patients with specific pressure-controlled ventilation from a single ICU-ventilator during the COVID-19 pandemic,"In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, which is responsible for a new human disease called COVID-19. Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.",2021,Anaesthesiol.

Characterization of partially observed epidemics through Bayesian inference: application to COVID-19,"We demonstrate a Bayesian method for the “real-time” characterization and forecasting of partially observed COVID-19 epidemic. Characterization is the estimation of infection spread parameters using daily counts of symptomatic patients. The method is designed to help guide medical resource allocation in the early epoch of the outbreak. The estimation problem is posed as one of Bayesian inference and solved using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The data used in this study was sourced before the arrival of the second wave of infection in July 2020. The proposed modeling approach, when applied at the country level, generally provides accurate forecasts at the regional, state and country level.

A simple lung ultrasound protocol for the screening of COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency department,"The most relevant manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is interstitial pneumonia. Several lung ultrasound (US) protocols for pneumonia diagnosis are used in clinical practice, but none has been proposed for COVID-19 patients' screening in the emergency department. We adopted a simplified 6-scan lung US protocol for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (LUSCOP) and compared its sensitivity with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in patients suspected for COVID-19, presenting to one Emergency Department from February 21st to March 15th, 2020, during the outbreak burst in northern Italy. Patients were retrospectively enrolled if both LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were performed in the Emergency Department. The sensitivity of LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were compared. COVID-19 pneumonia's final diagnosis was based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from nasal-pharyngeal swab and on clinical data. Out of 150 suspected COVID-19 patients, 131 were included in the study, and 130 had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The most frequent lung ultrasonographic features were: bilateral B-pattern in 101 patients (77%), B-pattern with subpleural consolidations in 26 (19.8%) and lung consolidations in 2 (1.5%). LUSCOP Protocol was consistent with HRCT in correctly screening 130 out of the 131 COVID-19 pneumonia cases (99.2%). In one case COVID-19 pneumonia was excluded by both HRCT and lung US. LUSCOP protocol showed optimal sensitivity and can be proposed as a simple screening tool for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in the context of outbreak burst areas where prompt isolation of suspected patients is crucial for patients' and operators' safety.",2021,Intern. emerg. med,"Dacrema, Alessandro; Silva, Matteo; Rovero, Luca; Vertemati, Valeria; Losi, Giulia; Piepoli, Massimo Francesco; Sacchi, Roberto; Mangiacotti, Marco; Nazerian, Peiman; Pagani, Laura; Tinelli, Valentina; Poggiali, Erika; Bastoni, Davide; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea"
Oncologic results of fertility sparing surgery of cervical cancer: An updated systematic review.,"BACKGROUND Several techniques can be proposed as fertility sparing surgery in young patients treated for cervical cancer but uncertaincies remain concerning their outcomes. Analysis of oncological issues is then the first aim of this review in order to evaluate the best strategy. RESULTS Data were identified from searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed and from references in relevant articles from January 1987 to 15th of September 2021. We carry out an updated systematic review involving 5862 patients initially selected for fertility-sparing surgery in 275 series. FINDINGS In patients having a stage IB1 disease, recurrence rate/RR in patients undergoing simple conisation/trachelectomy, radical trachelectomy/RT by laparoscopico-vaginal approach, laparotomic or laparoscopic approaches are respectively: 4.1%, 4.7%, 2.4% and 5.2%. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or RT by laparotomy are respectively 13.2% and 4.8% (p = .0035). After neoadjuvant treatment a simple cone/trachelectomy was carried out in 91 (30%) patients and a radical one in 210 (70%) cases. But the lowest pregnancy rate is observed in patients undergoing RT by laparotomy (36%). CONCLUSIONS The choice between these treatments should be based above all, on objective oncological data that strike a balance for each procedure between the best chances for cure and the fertility results. In patients having a stage IB1 disease, oncological results are quite similar according to the procedure used. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RT by open approach has the lowest RR. Anyway the lowest pregnancy rate is observed in patients undergoing RT by laparotomy.",2022-02-28,Gynecologic oncology,"Ph, Morice; Maulard, A; Scherier, S; Sanson, C; Zarokian, J; Zaccarini, F; Espenel, S; Pautier, P; Leary, A; Genestie, C; Chargari, C; Grynberg, M; Gouy, S"

Bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and their possible treatments,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the beginning of 2020 was triggered by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, severely affected various sectors, especially health. The effect of COVID-19 on patients is exacerbated by bacterial co-infections and secondary bacterial infections. There are few studies on how bacterial co-infections and secondary bacterial infections worsen COVID-19 patients, including in Indonesia. Therefore, it is necessary to update and summarize the understanding of bacterial infections characteristics to help optimize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment decisions. Antibiotics have been used in COVID-19 patients to treat bacterial infections to date, which could contribute to antimicrobial resistance in the future. The review's objective is to summarize bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and several possible treatments, including antibiotics, phage therapy, probiotics/prebiotics, and nanomedicine for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) delivery.

Enhancing Value and Uptake for Whole-Population Cohorts of Children and Parents: Methods to Integrate Registries into the Generation Victoria Cohort,"Health registries are critical to understanding, benchmarking and improving quality of care for specific diseases and conditions, but face hurdles including funding, bias towards clinical rather than population samples, lack of pre-morbid and outcomes data, and absent cross-registry harmonisation and coordination. Children are particularly under-represented in registry research. This paper lays out novel principles, methods and governance to integrate diverse registries within or alongside a planned children’s mega-cohort to rapidly generate translatable evidence. GenV (Generation Victoria) will approach for recruitment parents of all newborns (estimated 150,000) over two years from mid-2021 in the state of Victoria (population 6.5 million), Australia. Its sample size and population denominator mean it will contain almost all children with uncommon or co-morbid conditions as they emerge over time. By design, it will include linked datasets, biosamples (including from pregnancy), phenotypes and participant-reported measures, all of which will span pre-morbid to long-term outcomes. We provide a vignette of a planned new registry for high-risk pregnancies to illustrate the possibilities. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe such a methodology designed prospectively to enhance both the clinical relevance of a large multipurpose cohort and the value and inclusivity of registries in a population.",2021-04-07,Children (Basel),"Sung, Valerie; Williams, Katrina; Perlow, Ella; Hu, Yanhong J.; Ahern, Susannah; Said, Joanne M.; Karanatsios, Bill; Hopper, John L.; McNeil, John J.; Donnan, Leo; Goldfeld, Sharon; Wake, Melissa"

Does Oxidative Stress Management Help Alleviation of COVID-19 Symptoms in Patients Experiencing Diabetes?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with other comorbidities such as diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of diabetic nephropathy, which is attributed to hyperglycemia. COVID-19 produces severe complications in people with diabetes mellitus. This article explains how SARS-CoV-2 causes more significant kidney damage in diabetic patients. Importantly, COVID-19 and diabetes share inflammatory pathways of disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE-2 causes depletion of ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) from blood vessels, and subsequently, angiotensin-II interacts with angiotensin receptor-1 from vascular membranes that produce NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate) oxidase, oxidative stress, and constriction of blood vessels. Since diabetes and COVID-19 can create oxidative stress, we hypothesize that COVID-19 with comorbidities such as diabetes can synergistically increase oxidative stress leading to end-stage renal failure and death. Antioxidants may therefore prevent renal damage-induced death by inhibiting oxidative damage and thus can help protect people from COVID-19 related comorbidities. A few clinical trials indicated how effective the antioxidant therapy is against improving COVID-19 symptoms, based on a limited number of patients who experienced COVID-19. In this review, we tried to understand how effective antioxidants (such as vitamin D and flavonoids) can act as food supplements or therapeutics against COVID-19 with diabetes as comorbidity based on recently available clinical, preclinical, or in silico studies.",2022-01-13,Nutrients,"Paul, Alok K.; Hossain, Md K.; Mahboob, Tooba; Nissapatorn, Veeranoot; Wilairatana, Polrat; Jahan, Rownak; Jannat, Khoshnur; Bondhon, Tohmina A.; Hasan, Anamul; de Lourdes Pereira, Maria; Rahmatullah, Mohammed"

TTV Load is Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response in Lung Transplant Recipients,"Purpose Although the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are diminished in lung transplant recipients (LTR), probably due to immunosuppression (IS). There is currently no marker of IS that can be used to predict vaccination responses. Here, we study if torque tenovirus (TTV) can be used as a predictive marker. Methods The humoral response to the mRNA-1273 vaccine was assessed in 103 LTR, who were vaccinated 4 to 237 months after Lung transplantation. Spike (S)-specific IgG levels were measured at baseline, 28 days after first, and 28 days after the second vaccination. TTV loads were determined by RT-PCR and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to correlate serological responses to TTV load. Results Humoral responses to the vaccine COVID-19 vaccination were found in 41/103 (40%) LTR at 28 days after the second vaccination. 62 /103 (60%) had no detectable antibodies. TTV loads at baseline correlated with S-specific antibodies and the percentage of responders (=<0.001) (Fig 1). TTV loads also strongly correlated with the time since transplantation, indicating that participants with lower TTV loads were longer after transplantation. Conclusion This study shows an association between baseline TTV load and mRNA-1273-induced S-specific antibodies. If the TTV load is indeed a predictor of vaccination responses, this can be used in the future as a potential guidance for optimizing vaccination regimens. Therefore, we recommend that TTV load measurements are included in further vaccination efficacy studies in immunocompromised cohorts.",2022-04-30,The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,"Verschuuren, E.

SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a glycan switch of peripheral T cells at diagnosis,"COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that requires hospitalization. Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor, through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis. These new evidences pave the way to the identification of a novel glycan-based response in T cells that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients, highlighting a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.",2021-02-22,,"Alves, I.; Vicente, M.

Real Estate Markets and Lending: Does Local Growth Fuel Risk?,"Real estate price growth affects credit risk for several reasons: it provides input for economic forecasts as it’s closely tied to economic growth; when used as collateral by banks, rising real estate prices may decrease both expected and actual losses; and banks may become less risk averse in lending practices in the presence of rising property prices. Therefore, we analyze these effects on loan portfolios’ estimated and realized risks on a local level. Using data of 390 German savings banks, however, we find that real estate prices have little or no impact on savings banks’ credit portfolio risk or risk precautions.",2021-09-03,J Financ Serv Res,"Zurek, Maximilian"
Prevalence of Sclerotic Pterygoid Plate in Pretreatment Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of sclerotic pterygoid plate in pretreatment CT of nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (37 men, 14 women) with a mean age of 51.94±13 years, and 51 controls (30 men, 21 women) with a mean age, 49.31±15 years were included in this study in a retrospective fashion. All computed tomographic (CT) images were evaluated by two neuroradiologists. Sclerosis of pterygoid plate and other findings included pterygoid plate erosion, adjacent tumor enhancement, and parapharyngeal extension which were assessed. MRI findings were also recorded. The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis was compared using Chi-square statistical tests. Imaging findings were analyzed by binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 53.9% compared to the control group (16.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P-value< 0.001). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the prevalence of tumor adjacent to the pterygoid plate, parapharyngeal extension and pterygoid plate erosion were 69.6%, 81.4%, 38.2%, respectively. No erosion of pterygoid plate was detected in the control group. The odds of adjacent tumor enhancement and pterygoid plate erosion was 7.29 and 20.56 times higher in the sclerotic pterygoid plate (p-values of 0.019 and 0.000, respectively). MRI was available for four nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases with five sclerotic pterygoid plates, where two showed enhancements. All non-sclerotic pterygoid plates showed no enhancement on MRI. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sclerotic pterygoid plate is significantly higher in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with a considerably higher chance of adjacent tumor enhancement and pterygoid plate erosion.",2022,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,"Boonrod, Arunnit; Phuttharak, Warinthorn; Ounjaroen, Natta"
COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dental students: A multi-institutional survey,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate dental students' perceptions and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, their coping strategies and support resources, and their perceived stress levels. METHODS: A customized 19-item survey and the perceived stress scale (PSS) were applied to undergraduate dental students from the US, Spain, Ireland, Chile, India, and Brazil between April 10 and July 5, 2020. Linear modeling and mediation analysis were used to explore the relationships among demographics, stressors, coping mechanisms, social support, and stress RESULTS: A total of 4475 students responded to the survey. The majority (72.4%) were women, and 52.3% had no COVID-19 training at the time of the survey. The students reported that they had to accommodate to changes in patient care (96.6%) and didactic learning (95.2%) activities, while 88.5% of the respondents indicated at least one of their courses moved online. Transition to online courses went ""smoothly with some troubles"" for 51.8% of the respondents, and 48.3% perceived the faculty as prepared for the online transition; however, 45.9% reported feeling extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. The average PSS score was 21.9 of 40 (moderate stress). Multivariate models were built for participants with full data (n = 3899). Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS.

Masked Face Recognition Using Deep Learning: A Review,"A large number of intelligent models for masked face recognition (MFR) has been recently presented and applied in various fields, such as masked face tracking for people safety or secure authentication. Exceptional hazards such as pandemics and frauds have noticeably accelerated the abundance of relevant algorithm creation and sharing, which has introduced new challenges. Therefore, recognizing and authenticating people wearing masks will be a long-established research area, and more efficient methods are needed for real-time MFR. Machine learning has made progress in MFR and has significantly facilitated the intelligent process of detecting and authenticating persons with occluded faces. This survey organizes and reviews the recent works developed for MFR based on deep learning techniques, providing insights and thorough discussion on the development pipeline of MFR systems. State-of-the-art techniques are introduced according to the characteristics of deep network architectures and deep feature extraction strategies. The common benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics used in the field of MFR are also discussed. Many challenges and promising research directions are highlighted.

‘All We Have to Decide Is What to Do with the Time That Is Given to Us’ a Photovoice Study on Physical Activity in Nursing Homes †,"(1) Background: Despite high prevalence of physical inactivity and sedentariness among nursing home residents, research on the influence of environments on this topic remains scarce. This Photovoice study explores how structural and social environments relate to residents’ everyday physical activity (PA). (2) Methods: 27 residents, staff, and significant others conducted Photovoice in eight nursing homes in Germany to document factors facilitating or hindering PA. Photographs were discussed with the participants in eight focus groups and analysed using thematic analysis. (3) Results: 169 photographs (between 8 and 42per home) were categorized into three thematic groups: (1) ‘architectural challenges for PA promotion in nursing homes’; (2) ‘opportunities and limitations of using daily work equipment for PA promotion’; (3) ‘social incentives for PA promotion’. Photographs’ foci in the homes differed considerably between participant groups. Staff primarily chose environmental constructions and aids that they perceived to enable residents’ PA. Residents were more likely to express affections and emotions that would encourage them to be active. (4) Conclusions: PA promotion research in this setting should be sensitive to diverse perceptions of different stakeholder groups and existing power imbalances.

A spatial-temporal graph based hybrid infectious disease model with application to COVID-19,"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, reliable prediction plays an important role in policymaking The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19 In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect) For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening and provides potential outcomes for policymakers © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda All rights reserved",2021,ICPRAM - Proc.

Visions for a JACIE Quality Management System 4.0,"Quality management has been part of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the very beginning. It evolved step-wise from open data exchange up to the introduction of the FACT/JACIE-based quality management system (QMS) 2 decades ago. This formal step has eased cooperation, and improved outcome for patients. Today’s expansion of cellular and targeted therapies and new drugs, and the regulatory requirements for advanced therapeutic medicinal products have touched the limits of the current system. Based on the Medicine 4.0 concept, the next step should integrate novel views of QMS. The old definition “Best Quality Transplant” will be replaced by “Optimal Treatment,” and encompass the entire health care journey. “Best outcome” will refer to overall survival, quality of life and costs, with or without HSCT, and will be compatible with all requirements by competent authorities. Decisions will be based on high-level evidence, supported by real-time digitized data collection, data analysis, incorporated into artificial-intelligence systems. To reach this goal, EBMT/JACIE will be challenged to start the process by further fostering harmonization within and between organizations at institutional, national, and European levels.

Lactococcus lactis-fermented spinach juice suppresses LPS-induced expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines through the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs,"Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), a green leafy vegetable, is widely regarded as a functional food due to its biological activities; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have investigated the protective effects of fermented spinach against endothelial dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, this study investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of action of fresh spinach juice (S.juice) and fermented S.juice on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The HUVECs were treated with S.juice and fermented S.juice for 18 h before LPS exposure, and the levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Furthermore, to examine the changes in inflammatory responses to the two treatments, immunofluorescence analysis was used to visualize the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Western blot analysis was also performed to detect the differences in the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, specifically vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Both S.juice and fermented S.juice inhibited the LPS-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6, and suppressed VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Additionally, fermented S.juice inhibited the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) in an LPS dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin K2-enriched fermented S.juice is mediated by the suppression of the NF-κB pathway, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for inflammatory cardiovascular disease.",2022,Exp Ther Med,"Lee, Sang-Hee; Han, Ah-Ram; Kim, Byoung-Mok; Jeong Sung, Mi; Hong, Sun-Mee"
You took the words right out of my mouth: Dual-fMRI reveals intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting verbal interaction.,"Verbal communication relies heavily upon mutual understanding, or common ground. Inferring the intentional states of our interaction partners is crucial in achieving this, and social neuroscience has begun elucidating the intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting such inferences. Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a ""hyperscanning"" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round. Second, effective connectivity among these regions indicates the crucial role of the right TPJ in this process, consistent with the Nexus model. Third, neural signals within certain nodes of this network became aligned between interacting interlocutors. We suggest this reflects an interpersonal neural process through which interactants infer and align to one another's intentional states whilst they establish a common ground.",2020-12-29,NeuroImage,"Salazar, M; Shaw, D J; Gajdoš, M; Mareček, R; Czekóová, K; Mikl, M; Brázdil, M"
Portals of Change: How Patient Portals Will Ultimately Work for Safety Net Populations,"Despite the implementation of internet patient portals into the safety net after the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, little attention has been paid to the process of engaging vulnerable patients into these portals. The portal is a health technology tool that was developed with a mainstream, English-speaking audience in mind. Thus, there are valid concerns that such technologies will actually exacerbate health care disparities, conferring further advantages to the already advantaged. In this paper, we describe a framework for portal engagement (awareness, registration, and use) among safety net patients. We incorporate the experiences in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to illustrate important contextual factors for portal outreach in our safety net. Finally, we discuss considerations for moving forward with health technology in the safety net as the next version of patient portals are being developed.",2020-10-23,J Med Internet Res,"Casillas, Alejandra; Abhat, Anshu; Mahajan, Anish; Moreno, Gerardo; Brown, Arleen F; Simmons, Sara; Szilagyi, Peter"
Evaluating the root causes of fatigue and associated risk factors in the Brazilian regular aviation industry,"This work evaluates the potential root causes of fatigue using a biomathematical model and a robust sample of aircrew rosters from the Brazilian regular aviation. The fatigue outcomes derive from the software Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical phases of flight decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse totally or partially between mid-night and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period ($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases by 23.3% (95% CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum equivalent wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the number of night shifts and exceeds 24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10. The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of flight varies quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m. ($N_{Wocl}$). These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$ should be considered as key performance indicators and be kept as low as reasonably practical when building aircrew rosters. The effectiveness scores at 30 minute time intervals allowed a model estimate for the relative fatigue risk as a function of the time of the day, whose averaged values show reasonable qualitative agreement with previous measurements of pilot errors. Tailored analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before night shifts, commuting from home to station and vice-versa, and bedtime before early-start shifts show relevant group effects ($p<0.001$) comparing the groups with and without afternoon naps, with one or two hours of commuting and with or without the advanced bedtime feature of the SAFTE-FAST software, evidencing the need of a better and more accurate understanding of these parameters when modelling fatigue risk factors.",2022-01-14,,"Rodrigues, Tulio E.; Fischer, Frida M.; Helene, Otaviano; Antunes, Eduardo; Furlan, Eduardo; Morteo, Eduardo; Menquini, Alfredo; Lisboa, Joao; Frank, Arnaldo; Simoes, Alexandre; Papazian, Karla; Helene, Andr'e F."

The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector.",2021,Environ Res,"Pirasteh-Anosheh, Hadi; Parnian, Amir; Spasiano, Danilo; Race, Marco; Ashraf, Muhammad"
COVID-19 Outbreak: Neurological Manifestations beyond Cough and Fever,"COVID-19 outbreak is one of the most disastrous respiratory diseases (after the 1918 influenza outbreak) spreading in the community. So far, it has killed 7,37,417 number of individuals. High variability in the viral genome and its greater ability to spread in the human community is badly affecting the comorbid individuals. Although infected individuals are mainly possessing respiratory issues, neurological manifestations in these individuals cannot be overlooked. The literature search is based on the recent development in the concerned field. We searched databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""neurological manifestations"", ""CNS"", and ""PNS"". The major neurological complications observed in these patients are encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, smell/taste impairment, epileptic seizures, and abnormal states of consciousness. COVID-19 infection is just more than a cough, fever, and respiratory illness; it can cause indirect neurological complications in infected patients. It is therefore advised to treat and have a careful observation of the COVID-19 patients for neurological manifestations.",2020,"CNS neurol. disord., Drug targets (Online)","Kumar, Saurabh; Dwivedi, Divya; Chopra, Madhu"
Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet during COVID-19 national lockdowns: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is one of the healthy eating plans recommended to promote health and prevent chronic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries adopted restrictive measures to mitigate infection spread, which might have influenced people's lifestyle and dietary habits. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of stay-at home orders' implementation on adherence to MD. METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, and Web Of Science, the search strategy was developed using a combination of free text and mesh terms referring to COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, and MD. Studies published until March 31st, 2021 were included. We only considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and assessing modifications of adherence to the MD through validated dietary scores or any change in consumption of food categories that are typically ascribed to the MD. Data extraction, pooling and quality appraisal of the included studies, were conducted applying PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: 42 studies were retrieved. After duplicates removal, and in-blind two-step screening, 10 studies met our a priori defined inclusion criteria and were included in the review. 71.4% of the studies reporting a rate of change in adherence, measured through validated questionnaire both before and during lockdown, reported an increase, while 28.6% reported no significative changes. All included studies reporting the percentage of participants having a high adherence to the MD, based on their results on MEDAS questionnaire, before and during the lockdown, found an increase in this percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD could have raised in people undergoing lockdowns due to COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: The impact of restrictive measures on determinants of health must be monitored. Despite the literature suggests adherence to MD has declined in the last years, this trend may have reversed or, at least, slowed during the initial phases of the current pandemic.",2021-10-20,Eur J Public Health,"Della Valle, PG; Mosconi, G; Nucci, D; Gianfagna, F; Iacoviello, L; Bonaccio, M; Odone, A"

Studying the trend of the novel coronavirus series in Mauritius and its implications,"Mauritius stands as one of the few countries in the world to have controlled the current pandemic, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) to a significant extent in a relatively short lapse of time. Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors. Such findings will subsequently encourage the policymakers to implement strict precautionary measures in terms of constant upgrading of the current health care and wellness system and re-enforcement of sanitary obligations.",2020,PLoS One,"Mamode Khan, Naushad; Soobhug, Ashwinee Devi; Heenaye-Mamode Khan, Maleika"
Spotlighting Research During COVID-19: Introduction of an International Online Multi-Round Research Competition for Trainees,"PROBLEM: The coronavirus pandemic led to the cancellation of many academic events. While some transitioned to virtual formats, others disappeared, offering fewer opportunities for trainees to share research. Facing this challenge, the Association of Women Surgeons developed a novel approach. Designed to promote greater global inclusion, increase audience engagement and opportunities for networking and feedback from practicing surgeons, they restructured their annual trainee research symposium as a virtual, multi-round competition. APPROACH: Submission to the research competition was open to trainees at any level. The competition comprised four rounds: (1) visual abstracts (all welcomed), (2) three-minute “Quickshot” presentation (32 advance), (3) eight-minute oral presentations (16 advance), and (4) final question-and-answer style defense (final 4 compete). Progression through the first three rounds was determined by public voting. Winners were determined by live voting during the final session. OUTCOMES: A total of 73 visual abstracts were accepted for presentation. Fifty-six percent (n = 41) of first authors were medical students, 36% residents (n = 26), and 7% fellows (n = 6). Five were from international first authors (7%). Abstracts represented research topics including basic science (n = 6, 8%)), clinical outcomes (n = 38, 52%), and education (n = 29, 40%). Social media impressions exceeded a total of 30,000 views. NEXT STEPS: This virtual, multi-round research competition served as a blueprint for a novel approach to research dissemination. The format enabled expanded US national and international engagement with trainees in all stages of their career. Future research symposia should consider the impact of popularity bias, timing, and voting strategies during the event planning period to optimize success.",2022-05-16,Am Surg,"Thomas, Hannah S.; Siki, Mary A.; Lansing, Shan S.; Zogg, Cheryl K.; Patrick, Bridget; Towe, Christopher W.; Stein, Sharon L."
Incidence and determinants of high-sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptides elevation at admission in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial involvement in the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has been reported, though not fully characterized yet. The aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 patients. Cardiac biomarkers subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. RESULTS: Increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38 and 56% of the cases, respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and d-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03, respectively). Both hs-Troponin and NP were higher in patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and d-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B = − 0.212, p = 0.013; and B = 0.179, p = 0.037, respectively) and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001; and B = 0.253, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia. Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point toward existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting.

Discovery of Pre-Existing Drugs that Suppress the Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19), is responsible for the ongoing pandemic but still lacks approved antivirals. Repurposing pre-existing FDA approved drugs presents a rapid approach for new therapeutic options. In the present study, we report that three pre-existing FDA-approved drugs, i.e., vapreotide, grazoprevir, and simeprevir, inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cells. The E50 values of vapreotide, grazoprevir, and simeprevir against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells was 3.98 ± 0.35 μM, 2.08 ± 0.13 μM, and 1.41 ± 0.12 μM, respectively. In vitro biochemical experiments further revealed that vapreotide, grazoprevir, and simeprevir efficiently inhibits the unwinding activity of the Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of ⁓10, ⁓2.5, and ⁓1.25 µM, respectively, providing signs for understanding their antiviral mechanism of action. Given their good safety profiles in their original indications, our study offices new insights in repurposing these drugs alone or in combination with other antivirals in the global fighting against SARS-CoV-2.Funding: This work was financially supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (to H.Y.), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31770192 and No. 32070187 to H.Y.).Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no competing interests.",2021,,"Muturi, Elishiba Hong Wei Shu Ting Yang Wan Li Junhua Yu Junping He Jin Zhou Xi Wei Hongping Yang Hang"
Brazilian Adaptation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale: A Psychometric Investigation of a Measure of Coronaphobia.,"This study examined the psychometric properties of a Brazilian adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS-BR) in a sample of adults in Brazil. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the CAS-BR produces a reliable (α = .84), unidimensional construct whose structure was shown to be invariant across gender, race, and age. However, some items of the CAS-BR were stronger indicators of the coronavirus anxiety construct for women and younger adults. Although the CAS-BR demonstrated evidence of discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC = .77), Youden indexes were low to identify a clinical cut-score. Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS-BR scores and measures of functional impairment, generalized anxiety, and depression. Exploratory analyses revealed that CAS-BR total scores were higher among women and participants with a history of anxiety disorder. These findings are consistent with previous investigations and support the validity of CAS-BR for measuring coronavirus anxiety with Brazilian adults.",2021-02-02,Omega,"Padovan-Neto, Fernando E; Lee, Sherman A; Guimarães, Rayanne Poletti; Godoy, Lívea Dornela; Costa, Hugo Bononi; Zerbini, Francisco Luiz Silva; Fukusima, Sérgio S"
SARS-CoV-2: Insights into its structural intricacies and functional aspects for drug and vaccine development,"Globally, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as threat to life and economy. Researchers are trying to find a cure against this pathogen but without much success. Several attempts have been made to understand the atomic level details of SARS-CoV-2 in the past few months. However, one review with all structural details for drug and vaccine development has been missing. Hence, this review aims to summarize key functional roles played by various domains of SARS-CoV-2 genome during its entry into the host, replication, repression of host immune response and overall viral life cycle. Additionally, various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for finding a potent inhibitor have also been highlighted. To mitigate this deadly virus, an understanding of atomic level information, pathogenicity mechanisms and functions of different proteins in causing the infection is imperative. Thus, these structural details would finally pave the way for development of a potential drug/vaccine against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.",2021,Int J Biol Macromol,"Kaur, Mandeep; Sharma, Akanksha; Kumar, Santosh; Singh, Gurpal; Barnwal, Ravi P"

Long-term Time Series Data Clustering of Stock Prices for Portfolio Selection,"In this paper, clustering for stock data is conducted with two clustering methods, k-Shape and k-means with DTW distance measure and the results are compared. The data is the top 129 global electronics manufactures' stock prices from 2018 to 2020 which included the worst Christmas in 2018 and the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak. The involved countries are US, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and some others. The clustering results by k-Shape indicate distinctively different effects on those countries' stock markets due to the COVID-19 turmoil. The patterns of the clusters can be visualized to identify the differences among the clusters. We found that each of eight clusters comprises of the same country companies.

"Emerging infectious diseases, vaccines and Guillain–Barré syndrome","The recent outbreak of Zika virus infection increased the incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Following the first reported case of GBS after Zika virus infection in 2013, there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of GBS in endemic countries, such as French Polynesia and Latin American countries. The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), and GBS is another emerging research hotspot. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that GBS patients associated with Zika virus infection or COVID‐19 tend to manifest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rather than acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Causative autoantibodies, such as anti‐ganglioside antibodies in AMAN associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, have not been identified in GBS associated with these emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested molecular mimicry between these viruses and human proteins related to GBS. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of new vaccines, containing artificial messenger RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2, against. These vaccines are now available in many countries and massive vaccination campaigns are currently ongoing. Although there are long‐standing concerns about the increased risk of GBS after inoculation of conventional vaccines, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit administration of currently available vaccines, because the benefits outweigh the risks.",2021-05-17,Clin Exp Neuroimmunol,"Koike, Haruki; Katsuno, Masahisa"
Improved diagnostic stratification of digitised Barrett's oesophagus biopsies by p53 immunohistochemical staining.,"AIMS Interobserver agreement for dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is low, and guidelines advise expert review of dysplastic cases. The aim of this study was to assess the added value of p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the homogeneity within a group of dedicated gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-single haematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide referral BO cases [20 low-grade dysplasia (LGD); 20 high-grade dysplasia (HGD); and 20 non-dysplastic BO reference cases] were digitalised and independently assessed twice in random order by 10 dedicated GI pathologists. After a 'wash-out' period, cases were reassessed with the addition of a corresponding p53 IHC slide. Outcomes were: (i) proportion of 'indefinite for dysplasia' (IND) diagnoses; (ii) interobserver agreement; and (iii) diagnostic accuracy as compared with a consensus 'gold standard' diagnosis defined at an earlier stage by five core expert BO pathologists after their assessment of this case set. Addition of p53 IHC decreased the mean proportion of IND diagnoses from 10 of 60 to eight of 60 (P = 0.071). Mean interobserver agreement increased significantly from 0.45 to 0.57 (P = 0.0021). The mean diagnostic accuracy increased significantly from 72% to 82% (P = 0.0072) after p53 IHC addition. CONCLUSION Addition of p53 IHC significantly improves the histological assessment of BO biopsies, even within a group of dedicated GI pathologists. It decreases the proportion of IND diagnoses, and increases interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy. This justifies the use of accessory p53 IHC within our upcoming national digital review panel for BO biopsy cases.",2018,Histopathology,"van der Wel, Myrtle J; Duits, Lucas C; Pouw, Roos E; Seldenrijk, Cornelis A; Offerhaus, G J A; Visser, Mike; Ten Kate, Fiebo J; Biermann, Katharina; Brosens, Lodewijk A A; Doukas, Michael; Huysentruyt, Clement; Karrenbeld, Arend; Kats-Ugurlu, Gursah; van der Laan, Jaap S; van Lijnschoten, G Ineke; Moll, Freek C P; Ooms, Ariadne H A G; van der Valk, Hans; Tijssen, Jan G; Bergman, Jacques J; Meijer, Sybren L"

Fall of amalgam restoration: a ten years analysis of an Australian university dental clinic.,"BACKGROUND The use of amalgam in Dentistry has decreased since the 1980s. This study aimed to (i) assess the time trend in the usage of amalgam and composite in posterior teeth at Griffith University Dental Clinic from 2010 to 2019; (ii) to test whether this trend varied according to the dental health provider. METHODS We analyzed clinic records from 2010 to 2019. Prais-Winsten analyses were performed, and the average annual percentages change (AAPC) for amalgam and composite was estimated. RESULTS There were 397,013 procedures, including 80,995 direct posterior restorations. Amalgam use decreased from 12.9% in 2010 to 0.5% in 2019 among students, while composite use has increased from 87.1% to 99.5% of posterior restorations. The annual increase of composite was 1.4% per year for students, while amalgam decreased by 30.2% per year on average. A similar trend was noted among the dentists. CONCLUSIONS A significant decrease in the use of amalgam was observed over time for both students and professionals. This trend raises questions about curriculum reviews, focusing on the repair, maintenance, and safe removal of amalgam while reinforcing the learning on Minimally Invasive Dentistry and composite restorations based on the patient's caries risk.",2020-11-16,Australian dental journal,"Reher, Vanessa; Reher, Peter; Peres, Karen G; Peres, Marco A"
"Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China.","BACKGROUND Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed. RESULTS An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001). CONCLUSION Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elder age, high number of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.",2020-02-19,Allergy,"Zhang, Jin-Jin; Dong, Xiang; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Yuan, Ya-Dong; Yang, Yi-Bin; Yan, You-Qin; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong"
Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates occurring in India: Present scenario.,"Background The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still a debatable topic. The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.",2020-06-01,Indian journal of public health,"Devendran, Ragunathan; Kumar, Manish; Chakraborty, Supriya"

Schooling and Covid-19: lessons from recent research on EdTech,"The wide-scale global movement of school education to remote instruction due to Covid-19 is unprecedented. The use of educational technology (EdTech) offers an alternative to in-person learning and reinforces social distancing, but there is limited evidence on whether and how EdTech affects academic outcomes. Recently, we conducted two large-scale randomized experiments, involving ~10,000 primary school students in China and Russia, to evaluate the effectiveness of EdTech as a substitute for traditional schooling. In China, we examined whether EdTech improves academic outcomes relative to paper-and-pencil workbook exercises of identical content. We found that EdTech was a perfect substitute for traditional learning. In Russia, we further explored how much EdTech can substitute for traditional learning. We found that EdTech substitutes only to a limited extent. The findings from these large-scale trials indicate that we need to be careful about using EdTech as a full-scale substitute for the traditional instruction received by schoolchildren.",2020,NPJ Sci Learn,"Fairlie, Robert; Loyalka, Prashant"

Postoperative outcomes of 12 cats with ureteral obstruction treated with ureteroneocystostomy.,"OBJECTIVE To report complications and long-term outcomes of cats with benign ureteral obstruction treated with ureteroneocystostomy and to determine the effects of double pigtail catheter (DPT) placement on postoperative outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Twelve client-owned cats with ureteral urolithiasis treated with ureteroneocystostomy. METHODS Records were reviewed for signalment, location of the obstruction, diagnostic tests, surgical technique, perioperative complications, long-term measurements of kidney function, and survival. Cats were divided into two groups; in one group, a DPT was placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy, and, in the other group, a DPT was not placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy (NDPT). RESULTS A DPT was placed in six of 12 cats. The NDPT group included four cats with temporary catheters and two cats with no catheter. Median creatinine concentration decreased from 10.4 mg/dL (range, 1.6-20.3) to 2.2 mg/dL (range, 1.1-3.6) at the time of discharge (P = .015) in all cats. Two cats in the NDPT group required revision surgery for uroabdomen. Eleven cats were discharged from the hospital. Long-term complications (hematuria, pollakiuria, urinary tract infections) were more common in the DPT group (P = .047). Seven cats were alive a median of 329 days (range, 8-1772) after surgery. Median creatinine concentration was 2.0 mg/dL (range, 0.6-6.4) at a median of 157 days (range, 43-1772) after surgery. CONCLUSION Ureteroneocystostomy resulted in acceptable long-term outcomes in 11 of 12 cats. The placement of a DPT did not influence the long-term outcome in this small population. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Ureteroneocystostomy with or without intraoperative placement of a DPT should be considered to relieve benign ureteral obstructions in cats.",2020-07-31,Veterinary surgery : VS,"Lorange, Maxime; Monnet, Eric"

Efficacy of thromboelastography in the management of anticoagulation for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient: A case report,"RATIONALE: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to optimal conventional management, we should consider the indication for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 frequently causes coagulopathy, presenting as hypercoagulation and incidental thrombosis. For these reasons, a multifactorial approach with several anticoagulant markers should be considered in the management of anticoagulation using heparin in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man was infected with COVID-19 with a worsening condition manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was refractory to conventional therapy, thus we decided to introduce V-V ECMO. We used heparin as an anticoagulant therapy for V-V ECMO and adjusted the doses of heparin by careful monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to avoid both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. We controlled the doses of heparin in the therapeutic ranges of ACT and APTT, but clinical hemorrhaging and profound elevation of coagulant marker became apparent. INTERVENTIONS: Using thromboelastography (TEG; Haemonetics) in addition to ACT and APTT, we were able to clearly detect not only sufficient coagulability of COVID19 on V-V ECMO (citrated rapid thromboelastography-R 0.5 min, angle 75.5°, MA 64.0 mm, citrated functional fibrinogen-MA 20.7 mm) but also an excessive effect of heparin (citrated kaolin -R 42.7 min, citrated kaolin with heparinase 11.7 min). OUTCOMES: Given the TEG findings indicating an excessive heparin effect, the early withdrawal of ECMO was considered. After an evaluation of the patient's respiratory capacity, withdrawal from V-V ECMO was achieved and then anticoagulation was stopped. The hemorrhagic complications and elevated thrombotic marker levels dramatically decreased. LESSONS: TEG monitoring might be a useful option for managing anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO frequently showing a hypercoagulative state and requiring massive doses of heparin, to reduce both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.",2021-06-11,Medicine (Baltimore),"Nakashima, Ryosuke; Nishihara, Masaaki; Iyonaga, Takeshi; Iwasaka, Sho; Yamamoto, Yuzo; Shono, Yuji; Maki, Jun; Tokuda, Kentaro; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Higo, Taiki; Kitazono, Takanari; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki"
Passive transfer of virus-specific antibodies confers protection against reproductive failure induced by a virulent strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and establishes sterilizing immunity.,"Immune mechanisms mediating protective immunity against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are not well understood. The PRRSV-specific humoral immune response has been dismissed as being ineffective and perhaps deleterious for the host. The function of PRRSV antibodies in protective immunity against infection with a highly abortifacient strain of this virus was examined by passive transfer experiments in pregnant swine. All of a group of pregnant gilts (n = 6) that received PRRSV immunoglobulin (Ig) from PRRSV-convalescent, hyperimmune animals were fully protected from reproductive failure as judged by 95% viability of offspring at weaning (15 days of age). On the other hand, the totality of animals in a matched control group (n = 6) receiving anti-pseudorabies virus (PRV) Ig exhibited marked reproductive failure with 4% survival at weaning. Besides protecting the pregnant females from clinical reproductive disease, the passive transfer of PRRSV Ig prevented the challenge virus from infecting the dams and precluded its vertical transmission, as evidenced by the complete absence of infectious PRRSV from the tissues of the dams and lack of infection in their offspring. In summary, these results indicate that PRRSV-Igs are capable of conferring protective immunity against PRRSV and furthermore that these Igs can provide sterilizing immunity in vivo.",2002,Virology,"Osorio, F A; Galeota, J A; Nelson, E; Brodersen, B; Doster, A; Wills, R; Zuckermann, F; Laegreid, W W"
The Regulatory Dynamics of Sustainable Finance: Paradoxical Success and Limitations of EU Reforms,"The financial sector has seen a transformation towards ‘sustainable’ finance particularly in Europe, driven also by unprecedented regulatory reforms. At the same time, many are sceptical about the real impact of these reforms, fearing that they are triggering a paradoxical financialisation of sustainability. Building on recent research on institutional logics and institutional fields formation, we examine changes in the EU regulatory dynamics as characterised by shifts in framing the relationship between sustainability and finance. Deploying a longitudinal approach (2009–2019), consisting of archival data and semi-structured interviews, we explore the development of EU sustainable finance regulation as an extended, interactive and contested process. Specifically, we suggest that regulatory dynamics depend on the hybrid configuration of the social constituencies supporting sustainable finance reforms and on shifts in the overall prevalence of the financial logic in society. Our paper sheds light on the inherent contradictions and limitations of sustainable finance as a means for transformative sustainability reforms.

Exponential distribution of large excess death rates in Europe during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020,"Excess death rates E during the spring of 2020 are computed in N=340 level 3 European territorial units for statistics ---NUTS3 in Netherlands (44), Belgium (40), France (96), Spain (50) and Italy (110)--- from 2020 provisional week deaths, the population numbers for 2020, and observations in previous years (reference or baseline), all of them obtained from Eurostat web page. The distribution of excess death rates is found to follow an exponential law with empirical complementary cumulative distribution function Y following logY=a+b(E-Eave)/s. In the middle of the distribution b1=-1.356{+/-} 0.009; R2=0.998 are found and for the largest m=46 excess death rates b1=-0.645{+/-} 0.018; R2=0.992 is observed. This result suggests that abnormally large excess death rates may develop in statistical regions independently of what happens in the outside. Distribution of excess death rates are also analyzed on a country basis. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test does not reject the null hypothesis ""normal values of E for country i and country j come from the same parent distribution"" for any pairing. This is an evidence of a common background in the outcomes. In other words statistical differences among countries can be characterized by averages and standard deviations only. Average death rates, sample standard deviations, excess death tolls are: Netherlands 407x10-6,387x 10-6,8104; Belgium 667x10-6,364x 10-6,8436; France 228x 10-6,377x10-6,21780 (overseas departments not included); Spain 1059x 10-6,1149x10-6,48931 (Canary Islands not included); Italy 791x 10-6,1140x 10-6,49184; and 610x 10-6,877x 10-6,136435 for the combined distribution.

Cellular poly(C) binding protein 2 interacts with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus papain-like protease 1 and supports viral replication,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV encodes two papain-like proteases. Papain-like protease (PLP)2 has been proposed to play a key role in antagonizing host innate immunity. However, the function of PLP1 remains unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of PLP1 significantly promoted PEDV replication and inhibited production of interferon-ß. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify cellular interaction partners of PLP1. Host cell poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was determined to bind and interact with PLP1. Both endogenous and overexpressed PCBP2 co-localized with PLP1 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PLP1 upregulated expression of PCBP2. Furthermore, overexpression of PCBP2 promoted PEDV replication. Silencing of endogenous PCBP2 using small interfering RNAs attenuated PEDV replication. Taken together, these data demonstrated that PLP1 negatively regulated the production of type 1 interferon by interacting with PCBP2 and promoted PEDV replication.",2020,Vet Microbiol,"Zhang, Pengfei; Yu, Linyang; Dong, Jianguo; Liu, Yanling; Zhang, Leyi; Liang, Pengshuai; Wang, Lei; Chen, Bin; Huang, Li; Song, Changxu"
Automated Western immunoblotting detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies,"ELISA and chemiluminescence serological assays for COVID-19 are currently incorporating only one or two SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We developed an automated Western immunoblotting as a complementary serologic assay for COVID-19. The JessTM Simple Western system, an automated capillary-based assay, was used, incorporating an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 lineage 20a strain as the source of antigen, and total immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) detection. In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the EUROIMMUN® SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses. The automated Western immunoblotting presented a substantial agreement (90%) with the compared ELISA (Cohen's Kappa=0.64). Automated Western immunoblotting may be used as a second line test to monitor exposure of people to HCoVs including SARS-CoV-2.",2021,Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,"Edouard, Sophie; Jaafar, Rita; Orain, Nicolas; Parola, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; La Scola, Bernard; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier; Drancourt, Michel"
Effects of Healthcare Organization Actions and Policies Related to COVID-19 on Perceived Organizational Support Among U.S. Internists: A National Study,"GOAL: Perceived organizational support (POS) may promote healthcare worker mental health, but organizational factors that foster POS during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. The goals of this study were to identify actions and policies regarding COVID-19 that healthcare organizations can implement to promote POS and to evaluate the impact of POS on physicians' mental health, burnout, and intention to leave patient care. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey with an online panel of internal medicine physicians from the American College of Physicians in September and October of 2020. POS was measured with a 4-item scale, based on items from Eisenberger's Perceived Organizational Support Scale that were adapted for the pandemic. Mental health outcomes and burnout were measured with short screening scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The response rate was 37.8% (N = 810). Three healthcare organization actions and policies were independently associated with higher levels of POS in a multiple linear regression model that included all actions and policies as well as potential confounding factors: opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to COVID-19 (ß (regression coefficient) = 0.74, p = .001), adequate access to personal protective equipment (ß = 1.00, p = .005), and leadership that listens to healthcare worker concerns regarding COVID-19 (ß = 3.58, p < .001). Sanctioning workers who speak out on COVID-19 safety issues or refuse pandemic deployment was associated with lower POS (ß = -2.06, p < .001). In multivariable logistic regression models, high POS was associated with approximately half the odds of screening positive for generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and intention to leave patient care within 5 years. APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Our results suggest that healthcare organizations may be able to increase POS among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic by guaranteeing adequate personal protective equipment, making sure that leaders listen to concerns about COVID-19, and offering opportunities to discuss ethical concerns related to caring for patients with COVID-19. Other policies and actions such as rapid COVID-19 tests may be implemented for the safety of staff and patients, but the policies and actions associated with POS in multivariable models in this study are likely to have the largest positive impact on POS. Warning or sanctioning workers who refuse pandemic deployment or speak up about worker and patient safety is associated with lower POS and should be avoided. We also found that high degrees of POS are associated with lower rates of adverse outcomes. So, by implementing the tangible support policies positively associated with POS and avoiding punitive ones, healthcare organizations may be able to reduce adverse mental health outcomes and attrition among their physicians.",2022,J Healthc Manag,"Sonis, Jeffrey; Pathman, Donald E; Read, Susan; Gaynes, Bradley N; Canter, Courtney; Curran, Patrick; Jones, Cheryl B; Miller, Thomas"
Will an imperfect vaccine curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.?,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged from Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 continue to pose devastating public health and economic challenges across the world. Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).",2020-08-06,Infect Dis Model,"Iboi, Enahoro; Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Gumel, Abba B."

Triage and justice in an unjust pandemic: ethical allocation of scarce medical resources in the setting of racial and socioeconomic disparities.,"Shortages of life-saving medical resources caused by COVID-19 have prompted hospitals, healthcare systems, and governmentsto develop crisis standards of care, including 'triage protocols' to potentially ration medical supplies during the public health emergency. At the same time, the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities that together constitute a form of structural racism. These disparities pose a critical ethical challenge in developing fair triage systems that will maximize lives saved without perpetuating systemic inequities. Here we review alternatives to 'utilitarian' triage, including first-come first-served, egalitarian, and prioritarian systems of allocating scarce medical resources. We assess the comparative advantages and disadvantages of these allocation schemes. Ultimately, we argue that while triage protocols should not exacerbate disparities, they are not an adequate mechanism for redressing systemic health inequities. Entrenched health disparities must be addressed through broader social change.",2020-10-16,Journal of medical ethics,"Tolchin, Benjamin; Hull, Sarah C; Kraschel, Katherine"
"Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: interim results from a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 trial, and 3-month follow-up of a double-blind, randomised phase 1 trial","BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 µg or 6 µg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 µg with Algel-IMDG, 6 µg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 µg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 µg and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 µg with Algel-IMDG or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519. FINDINGS: Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (197·0 [95% CI 155·6-249·4]) than the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (100·9 [74·1-137·4]; p=0·0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (92·9% [95% CI 88·2-96·2] of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98·3% [95·1-99·6]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 92·5 (95% CI 77·7-110·2) in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 160·1 (135·8-188·8) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (88·0% [95% CI 82·4-92·3]) of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96·6% [92·8-98·8]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 µg with Algel-IMDG and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20·0%; 95% CI 14·7-26·5] of 190) and the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21·1%; 15·5-27·5] of 190) was observed on days 0-7 and days 28-35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 39·9 (95% CI 32·0-49·9) in the 3µg with Algel-IMDG group, 69·5 (53·7-89·9) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group, 53·3 (40·1-71·0) in the 6 µg with Algel group, and 20·7 (14·5-29·5) in the Algel alone group. INTERPRETATION: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. FUNDING: Bharat Biotech International.

The Effect of Internet Corpus Learning on Students’ Japanese Learning Motivations and Learning Effect,"Information education has been vigorously promoted in various countries, making the application of information technologies in language education popular. The combination of information technologies and Japanese learning can make information technologies a practical tool to promote the thinking and cognitive abilities of students in Japanese learning. Corpus teaching is a kind of information technologies integrated teaching method, which enables students to carry out meaningful Japanese learning and promotes learning performance and learning effect of students. Based on information education, the Japanese learning method under Internet corpus is constructed and applied to practical teaching. This study investigates learning performance and the learning effect of students through a questionnaire. Through the experimental design, Japanese teaching has been conducted on 322 students in a university in Shanghai for 18 weeks (3 h/week) under the experimental Internet corpus. Through the experiment, it is found that various factors affect the Internet corpus learning method, and the linear relationship between the influencing factors is divided. Through the comparison results, it is also found that the Internet corpus teaching method can have a positive impact on the learning performance of students and then promote their learning effect. The application of Internet corpus learning matches the development of text corpus and audio corpus and the support of picture databases. Audio and video corpora can effectively improve the learning performance and the learning effect of students by searching for learning content in the database.

Copper in infectious disease: Using both sides of the penny,"The transition metal Cu is an essential micronutrient that serves as a co-factor for numerous enzymes involved in redox and oxygen chemistry. However, Cu is also a potentially toxic metal, especially to unicellular microbes that are in direct contact with their environment. Since 400 BCE, Cu toxicity has been leveraged for its antimicrobial properties and even today, Cu based materials are being explored as effective antimicrobials against human pathogens spanning bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. Given that Cu has the double-edged property of being both highly toxic and an essential micronutrient, it plays an active and complicated role at the host-pathogen interface. Humans have evolved methods of incorporating Cu into innate and adaptive immune processes and both sides of the penny (Cu toxicity and Cu as a nutrient) are employed. Here we review the evolution of Cu in biology and its multi-faceted roles in infectious disease, from the viewpoints of the microbial pathogens as well as the animal hosts they infect.",2021,Semin. cell dev. biol,"Culbertson, Edward M; Culotta, Valeria C"

Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Large-scale Quasi-Experimental Study on Social Media,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a “mental health tsunami”, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide insights regarding people’s psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. METHODS: We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people’s social media self-disclosure. Using these data sets, we studied people’s self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets. RESULTS: We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis—mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people’s mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their “new normal.” Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This study shows the potential to provide insights to mental health care and stakeholders and policy makers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amid the health crisis.",2020-11-24,J Med Internet Res,"Saha, Koustuv; Torous, John; Caine, Eric D; De Choudhury, Munmun"

The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28-16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.004), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury. CONCLUSION: The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.",2020,Eur Heart J,"Shi, Shaobo; Qin, Mu; Cai, Yuli; Liu, Tao; Shen, Bo; Yang, Fan; Cao, Sheng; Liu, Xu; Xiang, Yaozu; Zhao, Qinyan; Huang, He; Yang, Bo; Huang, Congxin"
Decrease in ACE2 mRNA expression in aged mouse lung,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This has led to extensive speculation on the role of ACE2 in disease severity, and in particular, whether variation in its expression can explain higher mortality in older individuals. We examine this question in mouse lung and show that 24-month old mice have significantly reduced ACE2 mRNA expression relative to 3-month old mice. The differences appear to be localized to ciliated cells.",2020-04-05,bioRxiv,"Booeshaghi, A. Sina; Pachter, Lior"

"Satisfaction, quality of life and lumbar pain following laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy: suture vs. tackers.","OBJECTIVE To compare the operative results and rate of complications, in particular dorsolumbar pain, following laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LS) using sutures or tackers. STUDY DESIGN A case-control study: LS using tackers (n=35, tacker group) compared with LS using sutures (n=65, suture group). In addition to clinical evaluation of prolapse, all patients were evaluated for urinary incontinence (ICIQ-SF), dorsolumbar pain, overall quality of life (SF-36 score), and overall improvement in symptoms (PGI-I), one year after LS. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, initial stage of prolapse,…) were comparable in the two groups, as was operating time (240 vs. 210min, p=0.18). There was no significant between-group difference in terms of anatomical correction (median post-operative ICS stage: 0 in both groups, p=0.26) or post-operative complication rates. The incidence of de novo low back pain appearing after LS was equivalent in both groups (50% vs. 25%, in the tacker and suture groups, respectively, p=0.11). However, there was a significant difference in lumbar pain intensity evaluated using the visual analog scale (4 (IQR 0-6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-4) in the tacker and suture groups, respectively; p=0.01), and in post-operative quality of life, which was better in patients in the suture group according to all the questionnaires. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the use of tackers for prosthesis fixation to the promontory does not increase the incidence of post-operative dorsolumbar pain, but may increase its intensity and decrease quality of life.",2015,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology","Vieillefosse, Sarah; Thubert, Thibault; Dache, Arnaud; Hermieu, Jean-François; Deffieux, Xavier"
Determinants of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine: A public survey primarily focused on the usa,"Rationale: A considerable number of US-based populations are reluctant to accept the potential COVID-19 vaccine. However, the socio-demographic determinants for vaccine acceptance are yet to be explored. We designed a population-based survey to estimate the probable predictors for acceptance of COVID-19 immunization. Methods: The study was conducted between June and November 2020. A public survey link was sent out via the Redcap using social media and websites like Studyfinder and Researchmatch. Dichotomous (yes/no) questions were framed to understand the new COVID vaccine's future acceptability. Five sociodemographic variables were considered as potential predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, including age, race, education level, healthcare workers, and COVID-19 hospitalization among the relatives. We used the Chisquare test to determine whether the predictors, as mentioned earlier, influenced the acceptance rates. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between outcome(acceptance) vs. predictors and generate the rank list of significant predictors. Results: We received 1137 survey responses, including 19 'no response' to that primary question. Vaccine acceptance rates differed significantly among the groups categorized by age, race, and level of education, with χ2=17.63,p&lt;0.001∗ χ2= 35.87,p&lt;0.001∗ and χ2= 32.22,p&lt;0.001∗, respectively. Healthcare workers and COVID-19 hospitalization did not influence the vaccine acceptance rate. Participants belonging to the 'White' race had a higher acceptance rate than the participants who identified themselves as 'African-American' (83.6% vs. 63.5%;χ2= 22.80,p&lt;0.001∗). 'Middle age' group (group-III) (44-60 years) had the lowest acceptance rate (74.2%), while the oldest two groups ('61-70 years'(group-IV) and '&gt;70 years'(group-V)) had the highest acceptance rates (85.0% and 88.3% respectively). The differences among those age groups, as determined by Chi-square tests, were statistically significant (χ2=9.51,p=0.002 for group-III vs. group-IV and χ2= 11.54,p&lt;0.001∗ for group-III vs. group-V, respectively). Participants with 'High-school education' had a significantly lower level of approval (69.3%) rate vs. 'Masters' (88.2%) (χ2= 21.847,p&lt;0.001∗) and vs. 'Ph.D./Professionals' (89.9%) (χ2= 19.39,p&lt;0.001∗). The logistic regression model demonstrated an overall significance (χ2=67.38,p&lt;0.001∗). Level of education was ranked as the top predictor of vaccine acceptance, based on Wald χ2 (χ2=29.18,p&lt;0.0001), followed by age (χ2= 18.24,p=0.001∗) and race (χ2= 16.42,p=0.0009∗). Finally, the study participants who received the influenza vaccine in the previous years were more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine (χ2=79.88,p&lt;0.001∗). Conclusions: People with a higher education level, white race, and old age are more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Level of education was the top predictor of acceptance of vaccination, based on the logistic regression model.",2021,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,"Mondal, P.; Sinharoy, A.; Su, L."
Clinical and Virological Characteristics of Acute Sinusitis in Children,"BACKGROUND: Acute bacterial sinusitis is a frequent complication of viral upper respiratory infection (URI). We describe the clinical and virologic features of URIs that remain uncomplicated and those that precede an episode of sinusitis. We hypothesize that certain viruses are more likely to lead to acute sinusitis, and we compare viruses identified at the time of diagnosis of sinusitis with those identified early in the URI. METHODS: Children aged 48–96 months were followed longitudinally for 1 year. Nasal samples were obtained at surveillance visits, on Day 3–4 of the URI, and on Day 10, when sinusitis was diagnosed. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed on nasal washes for common respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria. A standardized score was used to quantify symptom severity. RESULTS: We evaluated 519 URIs, and 37 illnesses in 31 patients met the criteria for sinusitis. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected more frequently in URI visits that led to sinusitis, compared to in uncomplicated URIs (10.8% vs 3.4%; P = .05). New viruses were detected in 29% of sinusitis episodes, and their pattern was different than those patterns observed at surveillance. The median number of URIs per subject per year was 1 (range 0–9) in uncomplicated URI subjects and 3 (range 1–9) in sinusitis subjects (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who developed sinusitis experienced more frequent URIs, compared to children whose URIs remained uncomplicated. When nasal samples were obtained on the day of diagnosis of acute sinusitis, nearly 30% of children had a new virus identified, suggesting that some children deemed to have sinusitis were experiencing sequential viral infections.",2019-11-15,Clin Infect Dis,"DeMuri, Gregory P; Eickhoff, Jens C; Gern, James C; Wald, Ellen R"
Range of reproduction number estimates for COVID-19 spread,"To monitor local and global COVID-19 outbreaks, and to plan containment measures, accessible and comprehensible decision-making tools need to be based on the growth rates of new confirmed infections, hospitalization or case fatality rates. Growth rates of new cases form the empirical basis for estimates of a variety of reproduction numbers, dimensionless numbers whose value, when larger than unity, describes surging infections and generally worsening epidemiological conditions. Typically, these determinations rely on noisy or incomplete data gained over limited periods of time, and on many parameters to estimate. This paper examines how estimates from data and models of time-evolving reproduction numbers of national COVID-19 infection spread change by using different techniques and assumptions. Given the importance acquired by reproduction numbers as diagnostic tools, assessing their range of possible variations obtainable from the same epidemiological data is relevant. We compute control reproduction numbers from Swiss and Italian COVID-19 time series adopting both data convolution (renewal equation) and a SEIR-type model. Within these two paradigms we run a comparative analysis of the possible inferences obtained through approximations of the distributions typically used to describe serial intervals, generation, latency and incubation times, and the delays between onset of symptoms and notification. Our results suggest that estimates of reproduction numbers under these different assumptions may show significant temporal differences, while the actual variability range of computed values is rather small.",2020,Biochem. biophys. res. commun,"Pasetto, Damiano; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Gatto, Marino; Rinaldo, Andrea"

RNA isolation and quantitative PCR from HOPE- and formalin-fixed bovine lymph node tissues.,"The use of ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from Hepes glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect (HOPE)-fixed tissues in quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is fairly novel. We compared qRT-PCR analysis of formalin- and HOPE-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues from Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle by extracting total RNA using a commercial kit (Ambion) and a Trizol method. RNA extracted from HOPE-fixed tissues showed comparable quantities between the commercial kit (82.7-107.9 microg/ml total RNA) and the Trizol method (87-161.1 microg/ml total RNA), displaying a high degree of integrity when analyzed by electrophoresis. RNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues using the commercial kit produced similar concentrations (80.6-145.7 microg/ml total RNA) in comparison to the HOPE tissue; however, the integrity was compromised. Extraction of RNA from the formalin-fixed tissues using Trizol was unsuccessful. Following qRT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), total RNA from HOPE-fixed tissues showed higher levels of target messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (4.05 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using the commercial kit and 6.45 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using Trizol) in comparison to formalin-fixed tissues (5.69 x 10(-4)pg/100 ng total RNA). This could be attributed to RNA degradation by exposure to formalin fixation. In conclusion, the HOPE fixative proved to be a better source for RNA extraction from cattle lymph nodes and subsequent qRT-PCR.",2008,"Pathology, research and practice","Witchell, Jaydene; Varshney, Dhaval; Gajjar, Trusha; Wangoo, Arun; Goyal, Madhu"

Prokalzitonin auf der Intensivstation: Differenzialdiagnose und Differenzialtherapie,"Procalcitonin (PCT) is formed in IL6-mediated, IL8-mediated, and TNFα-mediated systemic inflammation conditions, in multiple organs and structures of the body. In patients with sepsis, significantly increased PCT levels are found. The PCT levels are highly correlated with the severity of the illness, and decreased PCT levels under therapy correlates with a better prognosis. In the differential diagnosis, measuring the PCT level helps differentiate between bacterial and viral infections. Noninfectious inflammatory reactions can, however, show moderately increased PCT levels. Cut-off values depend on renal and hepatic function. A therapeutic algorithm using PCT levels could be used for determining duration of a course of antibiotics, which can reduce antibiotic usage. In this paper, the differential diagnostic and differential therapeutic possibilities of PCT levels for critically ill patients are discussed.",2020-06-29,Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,"Großmann, S.; Schroll, S.; Pfeifer, M."
Key regulatory miRNAs in lipid homeostasis: implications for cardiometabolic diseases and development of novel therapeutics.,"Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with cardiovascular/metabolic diseases, including atherosclerosis, liver diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several miRNAs have been reported as regulators of different stages of lipid homeostasis, including cholesterol/fatty acid biosynthesis, degradation, transport, storage, and low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. Indeed, various miRNAs are emerging as attractive therapeutic candidates for metabolic/cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we summarize the roles of miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-27, miR-29, miR-34a, miR-144, miR-148a, and miR-199a in post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and their therapeutic potential. We also discuss experimental strategies for further development of these miRNAs as novel cardiometabolic therapeutics. Teaser: miRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators of lipid homeostasis. Here, we highlight key miRNAs that regulate lipid metabolism and their therapeutic potential in cardiometabolic disease states.",2022-05-09,Drug discovery today,"Khan, Abrar A; Gupta, Vinayak; Mahapatra, Nitish R"
Mouth-to-mouth ventilation is superior to mouth-to-pocket mask and bag-valve-mask ventilation during lifeguard CPR: a randomized study.,"AIM The quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a crucial determinant of outcome following cardiac arrest. Interruptions in chest compressions are detrimental. We aimed to compare the effect of mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MMV), mouth-to-pocket mask ventilation (MPV) and bag-valve-mask ventilation (BMV) on the quality of CPR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surf lifeguards in active service were included in the study. Each surf lifeguard was randomized to perform three sessions of single-rescuer CPR using each of the three ventilation techniques (MMV, MPV and BMV) separated by 5 min of rest. Data were obtained from a resuscitation manikin and video recordings. RESULTS A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years). Interruptions in chest compressions were significantly reduced by MMV (8.9 ± 1.6 s) when compared to MPV (10.7 ± 3.0 s, P < 0.001) and BMV (12.5 ± 3.5s, P < 0.001). Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 ± 0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 ± 0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 ± 0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 ± 0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 ± 0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 ± 0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV. CONCLUSION MMV reduces interruptions in chest compressions and produces a higher proportion of effective ventilations during lifeguard CPR. This suggests that CPR quality is improved using MMV compared to MPV and BMV.",2011,Resuscitation,"Adelborg, Kasper; Dalgas, Christian; Grove, Erik Lerkevang; Jørgensen, Carsten; Al-Mashhadi, Rozh Husain; Løfgren, Bo"

Understanding Current Needs and Future Expectations of Informal Caregivers for Technology to Support Health and Well-being: National Survey Study,"BACKGROUND: There are approximately 6.5 million informal (unpaid) caregivers in the United Kingdom. Each caregiver plays a critical role in the society, supporting the health and well-being of those who are ill, disabled, or older and who need frequent support. Digital technologies are becoming a ubiquitous part of everyday life for many, but little is known about the real-world impact of technology for those in a caring role, including the abilities of technologies to address the mental and physical impacts of caregiving. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the current and future technology use of caregivers, including digital technologies used to care for themselves and the person they look after. METHODS: We codeveloped a wide range of questions with caregivers and care professionals and delivered this survey both on the web and in paper format (eg, using social networks such as Twitter alongside in-person events). Questions were focused on providing care and looking after caregiver health and well-being. Analyses focused on both quantitative outcomes (frequency counts and Likert questions) and explored free text entries (thematic analysis). RESULTS: From 356 respondents, we identified that caregivers were receptive to, and largely positive about current and future use of technology both for their own care and their caring role (eg, checking in from distance). There were notable concerns, including the risk that technology could replace human contact. We identified several key areas for future work, including communication with health and social care professionals, and the potential for technology to help caregivers with their own health. We also identified several stakeholders (eg, care workers, pharmacy staff, and general practitioners) who could act as suitable points for technology signposting and support. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are a transient, often difficult to reach population, and this work has collated a large body of knowledge across a diverse group of individuals. Many caregivers, like the rest of society, are realizing the benefits of using everyday technology to help deliver care. It is clear that there is already a high level of dependency on technologies, where future expectations will grow. However, many barriers to digital technology use remain, including a lack of ongoing technology support. Preventive measures linked to technology that can help look after a caregiver’s own health appear acceptable, particularly for communicative tools. This collated caregiver knowledge is a call for all stakeholders—academics, policy makers, and practitioners—to take note of these specific challenges, and to ensure that caregiver voices are both heard and fully integrated within the emerging digital health agenda.",2022-01-27,JMIR Aging,"Egan, Kieren J; Clark, Patricia; Deen, Zahid; Paputa Dutu, Carmen; Wilson, Graham; McCann, Lisa; Lennon, Marilyn; Maguire, Roma"
Management of penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: An eUROGEN accelerated Delphi consensus study,"OBJECTIVES: To develop an international consensus on managing penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 acute waves. A major concern for patients with penile cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is how the enforced safety measures will affect their disease management. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may have an impact on the extent of the primary lesion as well as the cancer-specific survival because of the development and progression of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the COVID-19 literature was conducted in conjunction with analysis of current international guidelines on the management of penile cancer. Results were presented to an international panel of experts on penile cancer and infection control by a virtual accelerated Delphi process using 4 survey rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as an agreement of &#8805;80%, which was used to reconfigure management pathways for penile cancer. RESULTS: Limited evidence is available for delaying penile cancer management. The consensus rate of agreement was 100% that penile cancer pathways should be reconfigured, and measures should be developed to prevent perioperative nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The panel also reached a consensus on several statements aimed at reconfiguring the management of penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Adopting Telehealth During The COVID-19 Era: The Urologist's Perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the urology providers’ (through a range of training levels) experience utilizing telemedicine given the rapid nationwide implementation of telemedicine in urology practices due to COVID-19. Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the Patient Assessment of Communication of Telehealth which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in 2 categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine. Nevertheless, many providers are hesitant to schedule surgery via telemedicine. Providers would benefit from formal training in telemedicine.",2021-05-28,Urology,"Connor, Jessica; Zheng, Yu; Houle, Katherine; Cox, Lindsey"
Reducing the Risk of COVID-19 Transmission in Dental Offices: A Review.,"The COVID-19 epidemic has become a major public health challenge around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of August 2020 there are more than 833,556 dead and over 24,587,513 people infected around the world. This pandemic has adversely affected many professions around the globe, including dentistry. COVID-19, caused by the Corona virus family, is transmitted mainly by direct contact with an infected person or through the spread of aerosol and droplets. Dentistry by nature is considered to be one of the most vulnerable professions with regards to the high risk of transmission between the dentist, dental team, and patients; therefore, a protocol for infection control and the prevention and spreading of the COVID-19 virus in dental settings is urgently needed. This article reviews essential knowledge about this virus and its transmission and recommends preventive methods based on existing scientific research and recommendations to prevent the spread of this virus in dental offices and clinics.

Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine may follow a chronic course,"BACKGROUND: Rare autoimmune neurological events have been reported during the ongoing global drive for mass vaccination as a means of controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. Guillain-Barré syndrome, an acute inflammatory neuropathy well recognised as a rare complication of influenza vaccination, has been reported to follow administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. METHODS: We report four patients with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after vaccination in whom a relapsing or progressive course indicated the development of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of this complication and distinction from Guillain-Barré syndrome enables the timely institution of maintenance immunomodulatory treatment.

Pandemic Spread-an Empirical Analysis,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic started in late 2019, and was upgraded to a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Well established epidemiological models have been used over the last few months in an attempt to predict how the virus would spread. The predictions were frightening, and the resulting panic caused many governments to impose lockdowns or other severe restrictions, with lasting effects. This short paper discusses another way of looking at the spread of COVID-19, by focusing on the daily rate of infection, defined as the daily rate of increase in the number of infected persons. It is shown that the daily rate is monotonically decreasing, after a short initial period, in all countries, and that the pattern is similar in all countries. This appears to be a universal phenomenon. Based on these calculations, the April 1, 2020 data for Western Europe were sufficient to predict the beginning of the end of COVID-19 in that region before the end of that month.",2020,,"Ziegler, Zvi"
"Virus Infection Induces Keap1 Binding to Cytokine Genes, Which Recruits NF-κB p50 and G9a-GLP and Represses Cytokine Transcription","Proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription must be moderated to avoid the pathological consequences of excess cytokine production. The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-&#954;B p50 recruitment, but not for NF-&#954;B p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-&#954;B p50 and NF-&#954;B p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-&#954;B proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-&#954;B recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-&#954;B, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP.",2021,J. immunol,"Burns, Veronica Elizabeth; Kerppola, Tom Klaus"

An Effect of US-China Rivalry on Latin America and Its Implication,"English Abstract: Conflicts between the United States and China have been appearing in various forms across many regions;it can be seen in trade, commerce, politics, and diplomacy. In addition, it is likely that the conflicts between the two countries intensify as the multilateralism would be threatened and protectionism would emerge in the post-COVID 19 era. Latin America is not an exception to this issue of the US-China conflict. In terms of national security, the United States has only option to react sensitively to the growing influence of China in Latin America, considering the geographical proximity between the United States and Latin America. For this reason, varied conflicts between the United States and China occur in Latin America. This study nvestigated the patterns of US-China rivalry that appeared in Latin America and analyzed the effects of this rivalry on Latin American countries in multifaceted ways. In Chapter 2, we examined how the US and Chinese foreign policies against Latin America have changed. Furthermore, we summarized specific policies against Latin America that were implemented under the Trump administration. The fundamental goal of the US policy was to occupy a regional hegemony in Latin America by giving them incentive and pressure. In particular, the Trump administration tended to weigh on Latin America in many sectors such as immigration, infrastructure, and so on. By contrast, Chinese policies against Latin America aim at maintaining cooperative relations with Latin America in the absence of specifics. In Chapter 3, we presented several examples of the US-China conflict that were observed in Latin America. This conflict was mostly prominent in the infrastructure sector, in which the United States was likely to press Latin America in order to exclude China from related projects. In Chapter 4, we conducted an empirical analysis by focusing on the trade dispute between the United States and China that occurred in 2018. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of the retaliatory tariffs between the two countries on exports of major Latin America countries to United States and China. In addition, we complementarily examined the effect of the trade dispute on the welfare of the Latin American countries with the CGE (Computational General Equilibrium) model. As a result of the empirical analysis, Brazil’s export to China have increased significantly since the imposition of the tariffs, and then the effect has disappeared over time. In contrast, there was no consistent pattern for countries other than Brazil. The impact of the US-China conflict on the welfare of the countries in Latin America was trivial. The conflict between the United States and China that occurs in Latin America could be an opportunity for Korean companies that seek to advance into Latin America. The companies may be given an unintended chance as Latin America is faced by US pressure to rule out China from infrastructure sector. Therefore, it would be important to monitor the political position of Latin American countries in terms of seeking opportunities to enter Latin America in the future.",2021,,"Hong, Sungwoo Yoon Yeo Joon Kim Jin- O.; Rim, Jeewoon Nam Jimin"
BREAST CANCER MANAGEMENT DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MADRID: SURGICAL STRATEGY,"PURPOSE: From the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan (China), the infection spread all around the world causing a pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Spain has been one of the most severely affected countries, and Madrid has reported a high number of cases and deaths. We discuss our strategies for optimal breast cancer management during COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study at Clínico San Carlos Hospital to analyze breast cancer patient management during the pandemic outbreak and surgical strategy after the pandemic outbreak. We created a practical and dynamic tool based on a ""traffic light"" system for prioritizing surgical time. Every patient was contacted by telephone with a preoperative COVID-19 protocol. After surgical procedures, patient satisfaction was assessed using EORTC IN-PATSAT32. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients actively treated with surgical procedures were put on a waiting list and received systemic therapy. Telemedicine was used to evaluate any side effects and to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Surgery was only considered after the pandemic outbreak and then only those procedures designed to minimize surgical complications and therefore reduce hospital stay. We also measured patients´ satisfaction with medical and nursing scales that resulted “very good” evaluation tending to “excellent”. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to adapt the management of oncology treatment and the surgical strategy to optimize resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients´ perception of care quality and the degree of patient’s satisfaction with health services has potential relevance in the absence of outcome data.",2020-10-24,Clin Breast Cancer,"Brenes Sánchez, J.M.; López Picado, A.; Olivares Crespo, M.E.; García Sáenz, J.A.; De La Plata Merlo, R.M.; Herrera De La Muela, María"
Migraine and neuroinflammation: the inflammasome perspective,"BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine, which is a complex neuro-glio-vascular disorder. The main aim of this review is to highlight findings of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma from the inflammasome perspective. In addition, we discuss the limited data of the contribution of inflammasomes to other aspects of migraine pathophysiology, foremost the activation of the trigeminovascular system and thereby the generation of migraine pain. MAIN BODY: Inflammasomes are signaling multiprotein complexes and key components of the innate immune system. Their activation causes the production of inflammatory cytokines that can stimulate trigeminal neurons and are thus relevant to the generation of migraine pain. The contribution of inflammasome activation to pain signaling has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is the best characterized inflammasome and there is emerging evidence of its role in a variety of inflammatory pain conditions, including migraine. In this review, we discuss, from an inflammasome point of view, cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma, the connection with genetic factors that make the brain vulnerable to CSD, and the relation of the inflammasome with diseases that are co-morbid with migraine, including stroke, epilepsy, and the possible links with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Neuroinflammatory pathways, specifically those involving inflammasome proteins, seem promising candidates as treatment targets, and perhaps even biomarkers, in migraine.",2021-06-10,J Headache Pain,"Kursun, Oguzhan; Yemisci, Muge; van den Maagdenberg, Arn M.

Viewing the US presidential electoral map through the lens of public health.,"Health, disease, and mortality vary greatly at the county level, and there are strong geographical trends of disease in the United States. Healthcare is and has been a top priority for voters in the U.S., and an important political issue. Consequently, it is important to determine what relationship voting patterns have with health, disease, and mortality, as doing so may help guide appropriate policy. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between voting patterns and over 150 different public health and wellbeing variables at the county level, comparing all states, including counties in 2016 battleground states, and counties in states that flipped from majority Democrat to majority Republican from 2012 to 2016. We also investigated county-level health trends over the last 30+ years and find statistically significant relationships between a number of health measures and the voting patterns of counties in presidential elections. Collectively, these data exhibit a strong pattern: counties that voted Republican in the 2016 election had overall worse health outcomes than those that voted Democrat. We hope that this strong relationship can guide improvements in healthcare policy legislation at the county level.",2021,PloS one,"Hamamsy, Tymor; Danziger, Michael; Nagler, Jonathan; Bonneau, Richard"
"Medication Counseling Practices in Medicine Retail Outlets Found in Bench Sheko Zone, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region, South West Ethiopia","OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this research were to investigate pharmacy professionals’ counseling practices as well as to evaluate pharmacy professionals’ counseling skills and the content of counseling services provided to patients visiting medicine retail outlets. METHODS: A facility-based observational cross-sectional study was used to assess medication counseling practice by pharmacy professionals. Data were gathered through an observation and a semi-structured questionnaire. Epi data version 4.0.2 was used to enter data, which was subsequently exported to SPSS version 21.0 for analysis. ANOVA and post hoc statistical analyses were used to investigate the association between independent and dependent variables; and a 0.05 p-value was considered. RESULTS: This study has a total of 105 pharmacy professionals that were included in the analysis. The majority of those who responded were between the ages of 25 and 29. The most common drug information offered by pharmacy staff to patients was frequency of administration (90%), length of therapy (90%), and unit dose dispensed, according to the current study (86%). Pharmacy professionals’ age was significant on components of counseling practice as on mentioning the name of drugs during dispensing the medication (p=0.000), the route of administration (p=0.000), a drug dose (p=0.003), frequency of drug administration (p=0.016), proper medicine storage (p=0.024), type of dosage form (p=0.025), and duration of treatment (p=0.012). In comparison with the other age groups, an age greater than 40 years was significant on components of counseling practice (p=0.001) as a factor associated with penurious counseling practice than the other groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows that counseling practice is still quite low in comparison to what is expected. Some of the issues that affect counseling include a high patient load, the lack of a private counseling room, a lack of updated drug knowledge, and a lack of experience were factors that influence counseling.",2021-08-24,Pragmat Obs Res,"Ejeta, Fikadu; Feyisa, Diriba; Kebede, Oliyad; Aferu, Temesgen; Siraj, Jafer; Feyissa, Desalegn; Wodajo, Emebet; Tamiru, Alemu"
Co-benefits of biochar-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron in simultaneously stabilizing soil heavy metals and reducing their bioaccessibility.,"We investigated the performance and encapsulation mechanisms of novel biochar-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI-BC) used for the remediation of soil co-contaminated with arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) via incubation and column experiments. Compared with the control, 0.50% of nZVI-BC significantly decreased the leakage of As, Cd, and Pb by 97.94-98.45%, 42.86-81.12%, and 82.14-92.49%, respectively. In addition, 0.50% of nZVI-BC could transform the fraction of unstable heavy metals into a stable form, which substantially decreased the availability, leachability, and bioaccessibility of the heavy metals and hence greatly reduced the human health exposure risk. Column experiments showed that 0.50% of nZVI-BC effectively restrained the leaching of As, Cd, and Pb by 95.60-99.84%, 70.82-84.18%, and 91.68-99.81%, respectively. The predominant encapsulation mechanisms of nZVI-BC included complexation, precipitation/co-precipitation, reduction, and the formation of ternary surface complexes. Based on these insights, we can devise new strategies for the remediation of soil co-contaminated with As, Cd, and Pb.",2021-06-06,Journal of hazardous materials,"Yang, Dong; Yang, Shiyan; Yuan, Honghong; Wang, Fan; Wang, Hailong; Xu, Jianming; Liu, Xingmei"
Deep Learning Approach for COVID-19 Detection in Computed Tomography Images,"With the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, the establishment of an accurate and fast process to diagnose the disease is important The routine real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test that is currently used does not provide such high accuracy or speed in the screening process Among the good choices for an accurate and fast test to screen COVID-19 are deep learning techniques In this study, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for COVID-19 detection using computed tomography (CT) images is proposed The EfficientNet architecture is applied as the backbone structure of the proposed network, in which feature maps with different scales are extracted from the input CT scan images In addition, atrous convolution at different rates is applied to these multi-scale feature maps to generate denser features, which facilitates in obtaining COVID-19 findings in CT scan images The proposed framework is also evaluated in this study using a public CT dataset containing 2482 CT scan images from patients of both classes (i e , COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) To augment the dataset using additional training examples, adversarial examples generation is performed The proposed system validates its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods with values exceeding 99 10% in terms of several metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 The proposed systemalso exhibits good robustness, when it is trained using a small portion of data (20%), with an accuracy of 96 16%",2021,Cmc-Computers Materials &amp; Continua,"Al Rahhal, M.

Local and distributed manufacturing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Is crisis a window of opportunity for sustainable development in the Global South?,"Shortages of critical items during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a widespread mobilization of open, local and distributed manufacturing. In this paper, we examine the potential systemic impacts of these activities in the Global South, using the Multi-Level Perspective from literature on sustainability transitions. We conduct a longitudinal case study of a non-governmental organization that has been pioneering distributed manufacturing solutions in the Global South for almost a decade. We illustrate that the pandemic is a major landscape event that is having profound impacts on the existing socio-technical regime and niche levels. We show how niches mature over time, and that the pandemic has created an opportunity for niche replication and alignment. We present an initial analysis of factors that support and resist the path dependency of the existing regime. Thus, we speculate about the possibility to transition away from a development model predicated on the transfer of products from the North to the South, to an endogenous model of sustainable development that is underpinned by local design and production in the South. Here we show that crisis creates a key window of opportunity for sustainable development in the Global South through the formation of distributed manufacturing networks. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

"The Call for Bilateral/Regional Trade Agreements and the Salient Features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 of Sri Lanka","COVID-19 has resulted in extraordinarily challenging times. The outbreak has disrupted the lives of people and is casting a heavy impact on the economies around the world by interrupting business operations and commercial activities. Whilst everyone is busy identifying various strategies from short term and medium to long term to overcome the recession, the future projects a blurry picture at least for the moment. A study group consisting of eminent persons recently submitted a report to the President containing recommendations aimed at steering Sri Lanka into a post-COVID-19 era of economic recovery. One of the recommendations was on Trade Agreements. The suggestion includes action to revive and accelerate the negotiation of a trade partnership agreement with China;an expanded agreement with India;an agreement with Thailand and with other Asian countries particularly other ASEAN members including Japan and to maximize the benefits from the Agreement already entered with Singapore.In this backdrop, the question arises as to whether the existing laws in Sri Lanka on Trade and Anti-Dumping are sufficient to protect the domestic traders and domestic industries against any possible unfair trading practices and the possibility of an unforeseen surge of imports which may arise with the signing of more Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements. An attempt is made in this article to examine the key features and the effectiveness of the provisions of the legislation passed by the Parliament in 2018 on Anti-Dumping and to identify the protective measures that are sought to be introduced under the same.The Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018, and the Safeguard Measures Act, No. 3 of 2018 were certified by the Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament in March 2018. The enactment of these two laws was to remedy a need to answer the grievances of domestic producers and manufacturers. The official statement issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the occasion stipulates that Sri Lanka has taken a fairly long time to introduce the relevant legislation. This article proceeds to consider some of the salient features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 (the Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 Act) namely: (1) Part I of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 on Anti-Dumping Duties, (2) the procedural steps in investigations under Part I on Anti-Dumping (3) Part II of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 Act on Countervailing Duties, and (4) the procedural steps in investigations under Part II on Countervailing Duties.The Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 contains significant noteworthy features. Firstly, the act attempts to strike a balance between competing interests. The Right to Information on one hand and the economic value of sensitive trade-related information on the other. Secondly, the Act specifies timeframes for inquiries and related procedural steps recognizing the importance of resolving trade-related disputes in an effective, efficient, and efficacious manner. Thirdly the Act lays down a systematic procedure that ensures a fair opportunity be given to all parties with provision for public interest intervention. In terms of methodology, this article strictly adopts a doctrinal approach;doctrinal since the article proceeds to engage in an analysis of the law as it is on the four areas identified above. The enactment of these two laws will significantly improve the country’s standing in global trade and Sri Lanka will join the league of World Trade Organization - WTO members who keenly look to offset possible adverse impacts on their domestic industries from trade liberalization processes. The Gazette Notification making the Anti Dumping Law operable was issued on the 09th of October 2020 and the law is in force from 10 Oct 2020. The order by the Minister under section 01 was published in the Gazzetta Extraordinary No. 2197/4 – dated 12th October 2020. Both the laws on paper appear to be comprehensive. Yet the levels of effectiveness can be evaluated only when the Ac stands the test of time. The reason/s for the delay in making the law operational is unclear. Section 84(1) of the Anti-Dumping Act authorizes the Minister to make regulations in respect of all matters required by the Act;the hold may be attributable to the formulation of the regulations. It may also be due to the setting up of infrastructure to facilitate the holding of inquiries, arming the officials with the necessary expertise for the successful implementation of the Act, or the contemplation of changes in policy and the introduction of further amendments to the already enacted laws. The effectiveness and/or whether the existing laws are sufficient to protect the domestic producers in the event of a surge of imports is debatable. The existing laws at the moment are not operational and the effectiveness is yet to stand the test of time. At the same time, the need to further consider strengthening the laws to protect domestic industries and producers whilst entering into more Trade Agreements cannot be undermined.",2021,,"Perera, Rajitha"

Impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma: a study in patients with chronic hepatitis C after sustained virologic response,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has strongly influenced many aspects of the medical care, including cancer surveillance. AIMS: We investigated how the COVID‐19 pandemic influenced surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on patients with hepatitis C virus infection who were receiving surveillance for HCC after sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japan. METHODS: Patients who achieved SVR between 1995 and 2017 and continued receiving surveillance were compared by month in terms of the rate at which they kept their scheduled visits for HCC surveillance from July 2019 to May 2020. RESULTS: The percentage of kept scheduled visits was above 97% before February 2020. By contrast, it declined sharply after March 2020 when COVID‐19 became pandemic; the percentages were 75.5% in March, 63.0% in April, and 49.1% in May 2020 (July 2019–February 2020 vs. March–May 2020, p<0.0001). Similar declines were observed in patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and in those with a history of HCC. Whereas most patients who cancelled a scheduled visit before February 2020 did not reschedule it, the majority of patients with cancellations after March 2020 did want to reschedule. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of scheduled visits that were kept declined rapidly after COVID‐19 became pandemic in Japan, where the spread of COVID‐19 is relatively mild and the legal restriction of people’s behavior and movement is absent. Instituting measures to follow‐up with cancelled patients and resume surveillance will be necessary in the future.",2020-08-04,GastroHep,"Toyoda, Hidenori; Yasuda, Satoshi; Kiriyama, Seiki; Tanikawa, Makoto; Hisanaga, Yasuhiro; Kanamori, Akira; Kitabatake, Shusuke; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Shiota, Shohei; Furoi, Manabu; Koyabu, Takahiro; Furukawa, Daiju; Kumada, Takashi; Sumida, Yoshio"

Flexibility and Resilience in Corporate Decision Making: A New Sustainability-Based Risk Management System in Uncertain Times,"Risk management plays a key role in uncertain times, preventing corporations from acting rashly and incorrectly, allowing them to become flexible and resilient. A global turbulence such as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on individual companies and entire economic sectors, raising the question of whether a paradigm shift is necessary, in order to enable a new cycle of development that is much environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. This environmental and socio-economic context of profound uncertainty forces organizations to consider more carefully the risk factors affecting their business continuity, as well as how these factors relate to sustainability issues. However, there is a gap in knowledge about how risk management systems relate to sustainability management systems, and how both of them exert influence on business performance, especially from a theoretical point of view. The aim of this study is to address this gap, by developing a new interpretative framework for the analysis of risk management strategies in organizations. This approach has been identified in economic hermeneutics as an innovative methodological tool to improve the knowledge of risk and design the most appropriate management strategies. The paper provides two main results: the first one is the construction of a theoretical model that relates risk management to sustainability management; the second one is an operational framework of multidimensional risk assessment useful for analysis at different levels (business, competitive scenario and system). Finally, the model also makes it possible to carry out a sustainability assessment through risk evaluation in the perspective of the sustainable development goals.",2021-08-03,Glob J Flex Syst Manag,"Settembre-Blundo, Davide; González-Sánchez, Rocío; Medina-Salgado, Sonia; García-Muiña, Fernando E."

"Risk Factors for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Workers: A Seroprevalence Survey at Rennes Hospital, France","Background: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, health care workers (HCWs) have been on the front line in caring for COVID-19 patients. Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the prevention of disease among this population.Methods: We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French university hospital after the first wave (May-June 2020), based on a validated lateral flow immuno-assay test (LFIAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics as well as data on the working characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and 23 care activities were systematically recorded. The effectiveness of protective equipment was also estimated, based on self-declaration of mask use. SARS-CoV-2 IgG status was modelled by multiple imputations approach, accounting for the performance of the test and data on serum validation ELISA immunoassay.Findings: Among the 3,234 enrolled HCWs, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Contact with relatives or HCWs who developed COVID-19 were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during naso-pharyngeal sampling, patient mobilisation, clinical and eye examination was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without self-declared appropriate use of protective equipment.Interpretation: Main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs were i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (#35RC20_9716)Funding: This study was founded by the “NOMINOË” fund and the Rennes University HospitalDeclaration of Interests: None to declare.

The niche of One Health approaches in Lassa fever surveillance and control,"Lassa fever (LF), a zoonotic illness, represents a public health burden in West African countries where the Lassa virus (LASV) circulates among rodents. Human exposure hinges significantly on LASV ecology, which is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather seasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human behaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the disease, critically affects either the spread or control of human-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on LF burden date from the 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the improvement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such predictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of epidemics, the real impact of LF in West African communities will only be possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in research and public health approaches. This review discusses the causes and consequences of LF from a One Health perspective, and how the application of this concept can improve the surveillance and control of this disease in West Africa.",2021-04-24,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Arruda, Liã Bárbara; Haider, Najmul; Olayemi, Ayodeji; Simons, David; Ehichioya, Deborah; Yinka-Ogunleye, Adesola; Ansumana, Rashid; Thomason, Margaret J.; Asogun, Danny; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Kock, Richard A."
Hemodynamic Investigation of the Effectiveness of a Two Overlapping Flow Diverter Configuration for Cerebral Aneurysm Treatment.,"Flow diverters (FDs) are widely employed as endovascular treatment devices for large or wide-neck cerebral aneurysms. Occasionally, overlapped FDs are deployed to enhance the flow diversion effect. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamics of overlapping FDs via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. We reproduced the arterial geometry of a patient who had experienced the deployment of two overlapping FDs. We utilized two stent patterns, namely the patterns for one FD and two overlapping FDs. We calculated the velocity, mass flow rate, wall shear stress, and pressure loss coefficient as well as their change rates for each pattern relative to the no-FD pattern results. The CFD simulation results indicated that the characteristics of the blood flow inside the aneurysm were minimally affected by the deployment of a single FD; in contrast, the overlapping FD pattern results revealed significant changes in the flow. Further, the velocity at an inspection plane within the aneurysm sac decreased by up to 92.2% and 31.0% in the cases of the overlapping and single FD patterns, respectively, relative to the no-FD pattern. The simulations successfully reproduced the hemodynamics, and the qualitative and quantitative investigations are meaningful with regard to the clinical outcomes of overlapped FD deployment.",2021-10-16,Bioengineering,"Uchiyama, Yuya; Fujimura, Soichiro; Takao, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Takashi; Hayakawa, Motoharu; Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Karagiozov, Kostadin; Fukudome, Koji; Murayama, Yuichi; Yamamoto, Makoto"

The safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy is considered one of the most promising treatments in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the safety and effectiveness of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia patients need to be systematically reviewed and analyzed. Two independent researchers searched for the relevant studies published between October 2019 and April 2021 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, WAN FANG, and CNKI databases. A total of 22 studies involving 371 patients were included in the present study. MSCs were administered in 247 participants, and MSCs were allogeneic from umbilical cord, adipose tissue, menstrual blood, placenta, Wharton's jelly, or unreported sources. Combined results found that MSCs group significantly reduced the incidence of adverse events (OR = 0.43, 95%CI. = 0.22~0.84, P = 0.01) and mortality (OR = 0.17, 95%CI. = 0.06~0.49, P < 0.01), and the difference compared with control group was statistically significant. No MSCs treat-related serious adverse events were reported. The lung function and radiographic outcomes, and biomarker levels of inflammation and immunity all showed improvement trends. Therefore, MSCs therapy is an effective and safe method in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia and shows advantages in less adverse events and mortality. However, a standard and effective MSCs treatment program needs to be developed.",2021-07-02,,"Wang, J.; Shi, P.; Chen, D.; Wang, S.; Wang, P.; Feng, X.; Zhang, L."

Concurrent COVID-19 infection in children with acute appendicitis: a report of three cases,"Literature describing patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection with acute appendicitis in pediatric patients is growing, and understanding the clinical picture of such patients is relevant in their treatment. We report three male children who were surgically treated for acute appendicitis and had concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our first patient was a 12-year-old male who presented with symptoms indicative of appendicitis but no respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 (e.g. cough, shortness of breath). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms. Our third patient was a 13-year-old patient who also presented with symptomatic acute appendicitis without apparent COVID-19 manifestations. These cases provide further examples of pediatric patients with concomitant acute appendicitis and COVID-19 infection, namely an unusual presentation of perforated appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19-related pulmonary infection and the more common acute appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.",2021,,"Worhunsky, David J; Acevedo, Maximo J; Dylan, Steffey; Dillon, Johanne E; Lee, James T"
The Urgency of Policy Formulation: Dynamics of Covid-19 Handling and Big Data,"This paper attempts to discuss the role of big data to formulate policies in responding to social and economic threats due to Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia The use of big data as a primary source is based on the dynamic of spreading cases in other countries that were suddenly flared Those primary resources are online or open data such as population, social economic condition and infection case In related indicators, population is a big portrait of the countries, thus we observed the number of new infection per day, month and how it impacts the economy The research problem is how big data is used to formulate policy during the Covid-19 time We use Decision Theory under Uncertainty to explain three indicators that influence decision-making under Covid-19 This research applied Machine Learning R and SIR Model to obtain the latest data The argument is that big data can be used as a base resource for the policy formulation and decision-making In this case, base resource refers to first input in the policy formulation process as well as input and output information in the decision-making process",2021,IOP Conference Series.

The Norwegian way: COVID-19 vaccination policy and practice,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution of the national vaccination programme in Norway and how changes in national policy informed by risk and equity shaped international vaccine debates, public trust and vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Documentary analysis of publicly available statistics, government documents and media sources. RESULTS: Process equity founded on social solidarity was central to the approach taken to vaccination in Norway but within the context of a very low level of COVID-19 Infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of Norway with very low levels of infection, the risks associated with vaccine side effects were of a similar order to the risk of infection which led to an early decision to exclude the AstraZeneca vaccine and limit access to the Janssen vaccine. Public trust in the way the state managed the changes in the vaccination programme resulted in very limited public resistance to the vaccine programme, high levels of vaccine uptake and an acceptance of delays associated with the exclusion of two approved vaccines. Vaccination rates among Norwegian residents born in Eastern Europe were significantly lower than both foreign born and Norwegian born residents.",2022-04-30,Health Policy Technol,"Skjesol, Ingunn; Tritter, Jonathan Q"

Naegele's rule and the length of pregnancy - A review.,"BACKGROUND The proposition that a pregnancy is 40 weeks or 280 days in duration is attributed to the German obstetrician Franz Naegele (1778-1851). His rule adds nine months and seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The expected date of confinement from this formula is approximately right in the majority of cases. However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress. Forty weeks is such a simple, round, convenient figure that it has proved difficult to challenge, despite criticism. Nonetheless, what might have been an appropriate formula in Germany in the 19th century deserves to be revisited in the 21st. AIMS To review the length of pregnancy, in the light of current technology, in particular ultrasound scanning, and assisted reproductive techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A Medline search was performed for variables on the length of pregnancy, the expected date of confinement, and prolonged pregnancy. RESULTS A number of factors were found to significantly influence the length of a pregnancy, including ethnicity, height, variations in the menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, parity and maternal weight. CONCLUSIONS Naegele's rule should be considered as a guideline for the expected date of confinement, and not a definite date.",2020-10-20,The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,"Lawson, Gerald Wightman"
Salmonella Paratyphi A infection: implications for public health management of extra-intestinal presentations - case study of a neck abscess,"Abstract: This study explores the implications of unusual presentations of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) infection for public health management, through a literature review and case study. In 2016, a 36-year-old male presented with a five-day history of right sided painful neck swelling, coryza and a two-day history of fevers after arriving in Australia from India nine weeks earlier. S. Paratyphi A was isolated from a fine needle aspirate sample. A descriptive epidemiological review was performed of confirmed cases of S. Paratyphi notified in New South Wales between 2008 and 2017. S. Paratyphi was isolated in blood and/or faecal samples in 247 cases (98.4%). Only four specimens (1.6%) were from a focal site. A literature review of extraintestinal infections of S. Paratyphi A or B was performed. Of the 41 such cases reported, 16 (39%) had a clear history of a prior gastroenteritis and/or febrile illness, or information suggested this was highly likely. No preceding gastroenteritis or febrile illness occurred in 15 (37%) of the cases. Information was reviewed and presented with a public health lens, valuable for 'evidence-informed' public health risk assessment of contacts and exposures related to these types of S. Paratyphi infection. S. Paratyphi infection usually presents as an enteric fever illness. Our case illustrates the variable nature of infectious diseases and the importance of laboratory testing in obtaining a diagnosis. S. Paratyphi can have unusual presentations, which may require adjustment in the public health management of the case. Public health staff should keep an open mind when investigating possible sources and assessing risk. In Western Sydney, this disease is largely associated with residents travelling to high-incidence countries to visit family and friends, and receiving family visits from these countries. The increasing number of cases of S. Paratyphi (prior to COVID-19) in Western Sydney and the importance of awareness of the risk of enteric fever to travellers to endemic regions is highlighted.",2021,Communicable diseases intelligence,"Borsovszky, Moniek M; Norton, Sophie; Bag, Shopna K; Kok, Jen"
Pedal Gangrene in a Patient with COVID-19 Treated with Prone Positioning and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,"Many patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are treated with veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO) and prone positioning to optimize oxygenation. However, this combination can result in lower extremity tissue necrosis, especially without adequate offloading. We report a case of a 31-year-old male who required mechanical ventilation and VV-ECMO secondary to complications from COVID-19, and subsequently developed pedal dry gangrene.

Time-analysis of COVID-19 dispersion among health care workers and the general population,"IntroductionHeath care workers with direct (HCW-D) or indirect (HCW-A) patient contact represent 4.2% to 17.8% of COVID-19 cases. We evaluate the temporal COVID-19 infection behavior among HCW-D, HCW-A, and non-HCW. MethodsFrom February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, occupation, and symptoms in a COVID-19 testing outpatient health center. We allocated data into weekly time fractals and calculated the proportion of COVID-19 positive among HCW vs. non-HCW and incorporated an ARFIMA model (traditionally used in weather forecast) to predict future cases of COVID-19. ResultsAmong 8,998 COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, 3,462 (42%) patients were HCW-D, and 933 (11%) were HCW-A. Overall, 1,914 (21.3%) returned positive, representing 27%, 25% and 19% of HCW-D, HCW-A and non-HCW, respectively. HCW-D or HCW-A were significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-HCW (OR=1.5, p<0.0001). The percentage of positive to negative test results remained steady over time. In the positive cases, the percentage of HCW to non-HCW declined significantly over time (Mann-Kendal trend test: tau=-0.58, p<0.0001). Our ARFIMA model showed a long-memory infection pattern in the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases lasting for months. Average error was 1.9 cases per week comparing predicted to actual values three months later (May-July 2021). ConclusionHCW have a sustained 50% higher risk of COVID-19 positivity in the pandemic. Time-series analysis showed a long-memory infection pattern with virus spread mainly among HCWs before the general population.

Development of a cell-based hepatitis C virus infection fluorescent resonance energy transfer assay for high-throughput antiviral compound screening.,"A major obstacle in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been the lack of effective, well-tolerated therapeutics. Notably, the recent development of the HCV cell culture infection system now allows not only for the study of the entire viral life cycle, but also for the screening of inhibitors against all aspects of HCV infection. However, in order to screen libraries of potential antiviral compounds, it is necessary to develop a highly reproducible, accurate assay for HCV infection adaptable for high-throughput screening (HTS) automation. Using an internally quenched 5-FAM/QXL 520 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate containing the HCV NS3 peptide cleavage sequence, we report the development of a simple, mix-and-measure, homogenous, cell-based HCV infection assay amendable for HTS. This assay makes use of synchronized, nondividing human hepatoma-derived Huh7 cells, which support more-reproducible long-term HCV infection and can be readily scaled down to a 96-well-plate format. We demonstrate that this stable cell culture method eliminates common problems associated with standard cell-based HTS, such as cell culture variability, poor reproducibility, and low signal intensity. Importantly, this HCV FRET assay not only can identify inhibitors that act throughout the viral life cycle as effectively as more-standard HCV assays, such as real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, but also exhibits a high degree of accuracy with limited signal variation (i.e., Z' > or = 0.6), providing the basis for a robust HTS campaign for screening compound libraries and identifying novel HCV antivirals.",2009,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Yu, Xuemei; Sainz, Bruno; Uprichard, Susan L"
Design of an engineered ACE2 as a novel therapeutics against COVID-19,"The interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a pivotal role in virus entry into the host cells. Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability. This engineered ACE2 could be exploited as a novel therapeutic agent against COVID-19 after necessary evaluations.",2020,J Theor Biol,"Payandeh, Zahra; Rahbar, Mohammad Reza; Jahangiri, Abolfazl; Hashemi, Zahra Sadat; Zakeri, Alireza; Jafarisani, Moslem; Rasaee, Mohammad Javad; Khalili, Saeed"
Simplified TAVR Procedure: How Far Is It Possible to Go?,"Increasing operators’ experience and improvement of the technique have resulted in a drastic reduction in complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with lower surgical risk. In parallel, the procedure was considerably simplified, with a routine default approach including local anesthesia in the catheterization laboratory, percutaneous femoral approach, radial artery as the secondary access, prosthesis implantation without predilatation, left ventricle wire pacing and early discharge. Thus, the “simplified” TAVR adopted in most centers nowadays is a real revolution of the technique. However, simplified TAVR must be accompanied upstream by a rigorous selection of patients who can benefit from a minimalist procedure in order to guarantee its safety. The minimalist strategy must not become dogmatic and careful pre-, per- and post-procedural evaluation of patients with well-defined protocols guarantee optimal care following TAVR. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and limits of the simplified TAVR procedure in a current and future vision.",2022-05-16,J Clin Med,"Leclercq, Florence; Meunier, Pierre Alain; Gandet, Thomas; Macia, Jean-Christophe; Delseny, Delphine; Gaudard, Philippe; Mourad, Marc; Schmutz, Laurent; Robert, Pierre; Roubille, François; Cayla, Guillaume; Akodad, Mariama"
Beware of dogs! Domestic animals as a threat for wildlife conservation in Alpine protected areas,"Diseases are natural regulating factors of wildlife populations, but some pathogens may become an important threat in wildlife conservation, especially for endangered species. The presence of domestic animals may foster the spread of diseases in natural population, although their role in the dynamic of infections in wildlife is not clear. In this study, we investigated the presence and prevalence of a range of multi-host pathogens in wild species (red fox, Eurasian badger, beech marten, pine marten, stoat for a total of 89 carcasses analysed) and domestic animals (n = 52 shepherd and n = 25 companion dogs) living in a protected area of the Alps (the Gran Paradiso National Park) and discussed the role of domestic dogs as possible source of infection for wild species. Our results showed that domestic dogs are potential shedder of three important pathogens: Canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma sp. and Neospora caninum. In particular, shepherd dogs seem to represent a threat for wildlife as they are exposed to multiple pathogens because of free-roaming, scavenging lifestyles and close proximity to livestock. However, also companion dogs more subject to veterinary care may foster the spread of pathogens. Our results highlight the importance of regulating the access of domestic dogs to protected areas that aim at preserving biodiversity and enhancing the conservation of endangered species.",2021-07-13,Eur J Wildl Res,"Costanzi, Liliana; Brambilla, Alice; Di Blasio, Alessia; Dondo, Alessandro; Goria, Maria; Masoero, Loretta; Gennero, Maria Silvia; Bassano, Bruno"
A Stochastic Nash Equilibrium Problem for Medical Supply Competition,"In this paper, we study the competition of healthcare institutions for medical supplies in emergencies caused by natural disasters. In particular, we develop a two-stage procurement planning model in a random environment. We consider a pre-event policy, in which each healthcare institution seeks to minimize the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage, and a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs and the penalty for the prior plan, in response to each disaster scenario. Thus, each institution deals with a two-stage stochastic programming model that takes into account the unmet demand at the first stage, and the consequent penalty. Then, the institutions simultaneously solve their own stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state governed by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept. Moreover, we formulate the problem as a variational inequality; both the discrete and the general probability distribution cases are described. We also present an alternative formulation using infinite-dimensional duality tools. Finally, we discuss some numerical illustrations applying the progressive hedging algorithm.",2022-04-10,J Optim Theory Appl,"Fargetta, Georgia; Maugeri, Antonino; Scrimali, Laura"
Rational use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in times of covid-19,"Considering the COVID-19 pandemic declared, part of the researchers’ efforts has been in studies of repurposing chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), cheap medicines that have been used for decades with indication for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus Chinese and South Korean health officials recommended the use of QC and HCQ for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19, encouraging researchers around the world to assess the potential of these medicines as antivirals To date, results of three clinical trials have been released Two studies show divergent results for virological clearance, while the third suggests a benefit in terms of radiological and clinical improvement The three studies have methodological limitations and low overall quality of evidence, in view of the absence of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding patients, health care providers, and outcome assessors, missing data and/or selective reporting of results, as well as probable heterogeneity of patients and treatments, imprecision due to the reduced statistical power of the studies, indirect evidence for patients with severe form of the disease or patients with high severity comorbidities The irresponsible self-medication of these medicines is of concern both for the potential risk of shortages, as well as for the adverse events and potentially fatal intoxications Thus, in the USA, Europe and Brazil, regulatory agencies have positioned themselves in an emergency, authorizing the use of CQ and HCQ under medical criteria and/or in the context of clinical trials In Brazil, to restrict irresponsible self-medication and possible shortages, Anvisa included the drugs in a special control list Evidence on the efficacy and safety of QC and HCQ remains uncertain, so the results of ongoing studies are needed to adequately guide public policy and clinical practice Evidence-based health assumptions must be maintained even in times of international emergency due to the risk of having to deal with future complications from the irrational use of these medicines © 2019, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) All rights reserved",2021,Revista de Ciencias Farmaceuticas Basica e Aplicada,"Lucchetta, R.

Efficient functional screening of a cellular cDNA library to identify severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus entry factors,"The identification of host cell factors for virus entry is useful for the molecular explanation of viral tropisms and often leads to a more profound understanding of virus-induced diseases. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by SFTS virus. No countermeasures against the disease exist. In this report, we show an efficient method using virus-like particles for the functional screening of a cellular cDNA library to identify SFTS virus entry factors. Two variants encoding dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin related (DC-SIGNR), a calcium-dependent lectin known to enhance SFTS virus infection, were successfully identified from a human liver cDNA library.

Vaccination against Viruses,"Abstract Most vaccines in use today are the result of empirical development. The mechanism of action of many vaccines in common use remains incompletely understood. Understanding how such vaccines protect is an ongoing subject of study using increasingly sophisticated immunological tools, such as B cell and T cell repertoire and transcriptome analysis. Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use. Basic immunology, empirical vaccine testing, and regulatory science are all necessary contributors to developing the next generation of vaccines, including vaccines effective against the pathogens for which vaccines are not currently available.",2016-12-31,Encyclopedia of Immunobiology,"Greenberg, Harry B.; Dormitzer, Philip R."
Life doesn't stop teaching.No stopping learning!,"Background Since 23/03/2020, at a time of social isolation, uncertainties, crisis in service provision due to Covid-19 Pandemic causing great disruptions, Departmental teaching programme, running 4-5 times per week, was at a halt until unknown period. This meant no teaching for trainees through the teaching programmes, less connectivity between team members, low morale within the team. Objectives After a gap of 5 weeks, main objecting of starting once a week remote teaching on 30/04/2020, was to reinstate teaching and training opportunities in a safe and enjoyable manner and also boost team morale by 'staying connected with each other'. Methods PDSA included: 1. Gaining agreement from stakeholders in the Department. 2. Selecting a secure portal to run the teaching sessions remotely. We chose a portal that Trust was already using or higher management meetings. 3. Testing the portal one to one and then sharing the information with rest of the team. 4. Creating a teaching and training 'chat group' on the same secure portal for ease of communication. 5. Delivering first lecture by Organiser to 'break the ice' since technology was new to many. 6. Modifying the existing teaching rota to roster most trainees and including MDT sessions such safeguarding peer-review meetings, etc 7. Organiser helping with a trial run for a few minutes before the actual teaching session to avoid last minute issues or delay. 8. Constant development based on feedback from each teaching session until it became a 'norm' within the department by 6 weeks. Results Improved morale within the team. Some of the verbal and written feedback included 'it gave a sense of togetherness', 'positivity', 'enthusiasm', 'something to look forward to every week'. 'more interesting than face to face', 'less daunting', 'thoroughly enjoying'. Variation in attendance pre-covid (9-22) minimised to fairly constant attendance (15-22). Number of trainees attending without obligation when off work varied from 1-4 during each session. Those working in low risk areas or shielding completely, participates and attended more enthusiastically. After six weeks, from 16/06/2020, frequency of teaching programme increased to two times a week. Additional unexpected benefits were: . A trainee on maternity leave joined in remotely with a month old baby in her hand and she continued to do so afterwards until return to work. • A Greatix project was launched successfully for the department, without any undue delays waiting for face to face sessions. • Sharing of teaching material or feedback was almost instant after the teachings through the chat group whereas with face to face this wasn't a regular practice. Conclusions Remote teaching has a lot of potential to be part of our regular educational programmes, even when the current Pandemic is over. It can be an established way of 'keeping in touch' days for trainees away on maternity leaves or away from clinical area for any other reasons. Consideration should be given to regular National remote teachings through Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health so trainees mentioned above can stay connected with each other and benefit from remaining updated with clinical knowledge until their return to work.",2021,Archives of Disease in Childhood,"Singh, N."
Fatal iliopsoas and rectus sheath hemorrhage in a critically ill patient with COVID-19 on therapeutic anticoagulation,"Pulmonary embolism and thrombosis are two common postmortem findings in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the fact which led experts to include anticoagulants in the standard management of COVID-19. However, at least until now, no guidelines stated the exact safe yet optimal dose of anticoagulants. We report a case of a 65-year-old man admitted to our hospital with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. He showed remarkable improvement during the first 10 days of treatment at our facility but subsequently developed spontaneous iliopsoas hemorrhage (IPH). We discontinued antithrombotic and anticoagulant agents as soon as we confirmed the IPH from the abdominal computed tomography scan. His condition worsened even after he received adequate blood transfusion sets and eventually developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Due to the limitation of our hospital, we could not perform stent grafting and angiographic embolization. He finally died 6 days after the occurrence of IPH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of COVID-19 with IPH in Indonesia. As a developing country, many hospitals in Indonesia do not have stent grafting and angiographic embolization.

A Comparative Study of Various Strategies in Dealing With Covid-19 for SMEs (preprint),"In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic upended society and industry, in organisations the negative affect of the crisis disturbed various processes. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands struggled with constructing and implementing a proper approach for dealing with the crisis and adherence to the measures posed by the government. The ability for the organisations to rely on their past strategies regarding risk-management was not capable of continuing for such a long duration. Particularly since governmental regulations were highly dynamic as they changed quickly and were replaced. For many organisations Covid-19 created a high-risk work environment in which the resilient abilities of the organisations were addressed for survival. This research analyses handling of the Covid-19 crisis by using the concept of resilience in risk-management.The first section of the paper analyses the response of the Dutch government, the drawn up measurements are portrayed against the number of hospitalized patients. Next, we provide an overview of the concept of resilience and potential applications in solidarity, communication and scarcity are analysed on a national level. The second section focuses on practice, in which we look into organisations in different industries and their approaches for dealing with the Covid-crisis. The managerial decisions of three Dutch SMEs that operate both national and international have been analysed by conducting interviews. Resilience is proven to help in dealing with highly changing dynamic scenarios like the Covid-19 crisis;it is therefore coupled to the findings from the practical research. We concluded a number of guidelines from the interview results and literature review that aim to increase the resilient abilities of organisations. The guidelines are directed at the threshold for working from home, flexibility of offices and production lines, software for working from home, information use, supply chain flexibility, implementation of regulations and company culture.",2021,,"Hilhorst, Twan Rajabalinejad Mohammad"
Untangling introductions and persistence in COVID-19 resurgence in Europe.,"Following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in spring 2020, Europe experienced a resurgence of the virus starting in late summer 2020 that was deadlier and more difficult to contain1. Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave2. Here, we build a phylogeographic model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the COVID-19 resurgence in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 European countries and estimate that in many countries over half of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since June 15th. The success in onward transmission of newly introduced lineages was negatively associated with local COVID-19 incidence during this period. The pervasive spread of variants in summer 2020 highlights the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted, and this needs to be carefully considered by strategies to control the current spread of variants that are more transmissible and/or evade immunity. Our findings indicate that more effective and coordinated measures are required to contain spread through cross-border travel even as vaccination begins to reduce disease burden.",2021-06-30,Nature,"Lemey, Philippe; Ruktanonchai, Nick; Hong, Samuel L; Colizza, Vittoria; Poletto, Chiara; Van den Broeck, Frederik; Gill, Mandev S; Ji, Xiang; Levasseur, Anthony; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Koopmans, Marion; Sadilek, Adam; Lai, Shengjie; Tatem, Andrew J; Baele, Guy; Suchard, Marc A; Dellicour, Simon"
Calibrating COVID-19 SEIR models with time-varying effective contact rates,"We describe the population-based SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, removed) model developed by the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG), which advises the Irish government on COVID-19 responses. The model assumes a time-varying effective contact rate (equivalently, a time-varying reproduction number) to model the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A crucial technical challenge in applying such models is their accurate calibration to observed data, e.g., to the daily number of confirmed new cases, as the past history of the disease strongly affects predictions of future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach based on inversion of the SEIR equations in conjunction with statistical modelling and spline-fitting of the data, to produce a robust methodology for calibration of a wide class of models of this type.",2021,,"Gleeson, James Murphy Thomas Brendan O'Brien Joseph Friel Nial Bargary Norma O'Sullivan David"
Markers of inflammation and their association with muscle strength and mass: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND Chronic inflammation has been associated with sarcopenia and its components skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between systemic inflammation, muscle strength and/or muscle mass in adults. METHODS An electronic search using keywords such as 'acute phase proteins, cytokines and sarcopenia, muscle mass, muscle strength' was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase from inception until the 30th of June 2020. A meta-analysis using correlation data was performed to determine the overall relationship between inflammation and muscle strength and muscle mass in adults. RESULTS Overall, 168 articles; 149 cross-sectional articles (n = 76,899 participants, 47.0 % male) and 19 longitudinal articles (n = 12,295 participants, 31.9 % male) met inclusion criteria. Independent of disease state, higher levels of C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were associated with lower handgrip and knee extension strength (CRP; r = -0.10, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.13, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.08, p < 0.001 and CRP; r = -0.18, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.11, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.13, p < 0.001 respectively) and muscle mass (CRP; r = -0.12, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.09, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.15, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers appeared to be associated with lower muscle strength and muscle mass over time. CONCLUSION Higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers are significantly associated with lower skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass.",2020-09-26,Ageing research reviews,"Tuttle, Camilla S L; Thang, Lachlan A N; Maier, Andrea B"
Beyond Agenda 2030: Future-Oriented Mechanisms in Localising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"Given the complex nature of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are increasing calls for new inclusive and bottom-up governance mechanisms in building a relationship between governments and their citizens, in particular, the youth, to localise the 2030 Agenda But such successful bottom-up multi-stakeholder engagement tools have yet to emerge in practice Hence, of specific interest in this study is exploring bottom-up approaches useful for localising the SDGs and harnessing real transformative change to leave no one behind by 2030 Using a case study from the UK, we present a novel integrated mechanism to achieve this An integrated Social Innovation (SI) and Scenarios Thinking (ST) mechanism remains a valuable bottom-up tool capable of empowering citizens, including the youth and decision-makers in delivering coherent SDGs plans, policies, and programmes The study reveals that although the SDGs are distinct, they are also interconnected A scenario development workshop with youth with no prior knowledge of the SDGs showed a common thread of policy measures for different SDG future images Standard policy measures amongst different SDGs call for an equitable society at all levels;that all energy sources be from clean and renewable sources;investment in low-carbon technologies and research;and financial support for promoting sustainable transportation and consumption measures This study highlights that we need to change how we think and talk about SDGs and recommends socially innovative steps to embrace cross-sectoral and nexus thinking as the backdrop of the citizen science concept We conclude that the SDGs should not become a performative exercise or failed social experiment And any practical localisation from the UN’s Member States across the northern and southern hemispheres will require robust measures addressing future-oriented systemic thinking, inclusivity and good governance, together with standards for community resilience and sustainability",2020,Sustainability,"TyreeHageman, Jennifer Kele Juliet"

"COVID-19 pandemic: an online-based survey of knowledge, perception, and adherence to preventive measures among educated Nigerian adults","Aims: One of the ways to manage the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is to monitor the public knowledge, risk perceptions, adherence to preventive measures, and level of preparedness behaviors. This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults &#8805;18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors' social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. Results: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently. Predictors of self-perceived risk of COVID-19 were age 40-59 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.217-3.435), &#8805; 60 years (OR 4.68, CI 1.888-11.583), and visiting crowded places (OR 2.27, CI 1.499-3.448).

Microbiome First Medicine in Health and Safety,"Microbiome First Medicine is a suggested 21st century healthcare paradigm that prioritizes the entire human, the human superorganism, beginning with the microbiome. To date, much of medicine has protected and treated patients as if they were a single species. This has resulted in unintended damage to the microbiome and an epidemic of chronic disorders [e.g., noncommunicable diseases and conditions (NCDs)]. Along with NCDs came loss of colonization resistance, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, and increasing multimorbidity and polypharmacy over the life course. To move toward sustainable healthcare, the human microbiome needs to be front and center. This paper presents microbiome-human physiology from the view of systems biology regulation. It also details the ongoing NCD epidemic including the role of existing drugs and other factors that damage the human microbiome. Examples are provided for two entryway NCDs, asthma and obesity, regarding their extensive network of comorbid NCDs. Finally, the challenges of ensuring safety for the microbiome are detailed. Under Microbiome-First Medicine and considering the importance of keystone bacteria and critical windows of development, changes in even a few microbiota-prioritized medical decisions could make a significant difference in health across the life course.",2021-08-27,Biomedicines,"Dietert, Rodney R."

Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients Infected With 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1): Report From a Canadian Province,"BACKGROUND: 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) has led to a global increase in severe respiratory illness. Little is known about kidney outcomes and dialytic requirements in critically ill patients infected with pandemic H1N1. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 50 patients with pandemic H1N1 admitted to any of 7 intensive care units in Manitoba, Canada, were prospectively followed. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were kidney injury and kidney failure defined using RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage disease) criteria or need for dialysis therapy. RESULTS: The pandemic H1N1 group was composed of 50 critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 with severe respiratory syndrome (47 confirmed cases, 3 probable). Kidney injury, kidney failure, and need for dialysis occurred in 66.7%, 66%, and 11% of patients, respectively. Mortality was 16%. Kidney failure was associated with increased death (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 1.29-98.9), whereas the need for dialysis was associated with an increase in length of stay (RR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.13-25.75). LIMITATIONS: Small population studied from single Canadian province; thus, limited generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1, kidney injury, kidney failure, and the need for dialysis are common and associated with an increase in mortality and length of intensive care unit stay.",2010-03-19,Am J Kidney Dis,"Sood, Manish M.; Rigatto, Claudio; Zarychanski, Ryan; Komenda, Paul; Sood, Amy R.; Bueti, Joe; Reslerova, Martina; Roberts, Dan; Mojica, Julie; Kumar, Anand"

A Therapeutic Relational Agent for Reducing Problematic Substance Use (Woebot): Development and Usability Study,"BACKGROUND: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. RESULTS: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

Protecting IP of Deep Neural Networks with Watermarking: A New Label Helps,"Deep neural network (DNN) models have shown great success in almost every artificial area. It is a non-trivial task to build a good DNN model. Nowadays, various MLaaS providers have launched their cloud services, which trains DNN models for users. Once they are released, driven by potential monetary profit, the models may be duplicated, resold, or redistributed by adversaries, including greedy service providers themselves. To mitigate this threat, in this paper, we propose an innovative framework to protect the intellectual property of deep learning models, that is, watermarking the model by adding a new label to crafted key samples during training. The intuition comes from the fact that, compared with existing DNN watermarking methods, adding a new label will not twist the original decision boundary but can help the model learn the features of key samples better. We implement a prototype of our framework and evaluate the performance under three different benchmark datasets, and investigate the relationship between model accuracy, perturbation strength, and key samples’ length. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed method performs better under small perturbation strength or short key samples’ length in terms of classification accuracy and ownership verification efficiency.",2020-04-17,Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,"Zhong, Qi; Zhang, Leo Yu; Zhang, Jun; Gao, Longxiang; Xiang, Yong"
Establishment of Stable Cell Lines With High Expression of Heterodimers of Human 4F2hc and Human Amino Acid Transporter LAT1 or LAT2 and Delineation of Their Differential Interaction With α-Alkyl Moieties,"System L is a major transport system for cellular uptake of neutral amino acids. Among system L transporters, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is responsible for the nutrient uptake in cancer cells, whereas L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) is a transporter for non-cancer cells. In this study, we have established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing high levels of human LAT1 and LAT2 forming heterodimers with native human 4F2hc of the cells. We have found that l-[(14)C]alanine is an appropriate substrate to examine the function of LAT2, whereas l-[(14)C]leucine is used for LAT1. By using l-[(14)C]alanine on LAT2, we have for the first time directly evaluated the function of human LAT2 expressed in mammalian cells and obtained its reliable kinetics. Using α-alkyl amino acids including α-methyl-alanine and α-ethyl-l-alanine, we have demonstrated that α-alkyl groups interfere with the interaction with LAT2. These cell lines with higher practical advantages would be useful for screening and analyzing compounds to develop LAT1-specific drugs that can be used for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The strategy that we took to establish the cell lines would also be applicable to the other heterodimeric transporters with important therapeutic implications.",2019-06-11,J Pharmacol Sci,"Khunweeraphong, Narakorn; Nagamori, Shushi; Wiriyasermkul, Pattama; Nishinaka, Yumiko; Wongthai, Printip; Ohgaki, Ryuichi; Tanaka, Hidekazu; Tominaga, Hideyuki; Sakurai, Hiroyuki; Kanai, Yoshikatsu"

Outcomes of a Two-Tiered Multifaceted Elderly Suicide Prevention Program in a Hong Kong Chinese Community,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the 2-year completed suicide and reattempt rates in a preintervention group of Hong Kong Chinese suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) who received standard care and a postintervention group enrolled in a regional elderly suicide prevention program (ESPP) that adopts a two-tiered multifaceted care management model and 2) to examine the trend of suicide rates in older adults aged 65 years and older in the pre- and postintervention periods. DESIGN: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. SETTING: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. PARTICIPANTS: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre- and postintervention phases. MEASUREMENTS: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre- and postintervention periods. RESULTS: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99$% in the ESPP group (N = 351) χ(2) = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period.

"Over Fifty Years of Life, Death, and Cannibalism: A Historical Recollection of Apoptosis and Autophagy","Research in biomedical sciences has changed dramatically over the past fifty years. There is no doubt that the discovery of apoptosis and autophagy as two highly synchronized and regulated mechanisms in cellular homeostasis are among the most important discoveries in these decades. Along with the advancement in molecular biology, identifying the genetic players in apoptosis and autophagy has shed light on our understanding of their function in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we first describe the history of key discoveries in apoptosis with a molecular insight and continue with apoptosis pathways and their regulation. We touch upon the role of apoptosis in human health and its malfunction in several diseases. We discuss the path to the morphological and molecular discovery of autophagy. Moreover, we dive deep into the precise regulation of autophagy and recent findings from basic research to clinical applications of autophagy modulation in human health and illnesses and the available therapies for many diseases caused by impaired autophagy.

Impact of Evolving Protocols and COVID-19 on Internet Traffic Shares,"The rapid deployment of new Internet protocols over the last few years and the COVID-19 pandemic more recently (2020) has resulted in a change in the Internet traffic composition. Consequently, an updated microscopic view of traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic composition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We analyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI (Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the impact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018 to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the CAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to 6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the application layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S) traffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than 90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to previous studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up to a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study further reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly depending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized methodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring datasets.",2022-01-01,,"Schumann, Luca; Doan, Trinh Viet; Shreedhar, Tanya; Mok, Ricky; Bajpai, Vaibhav"

Stigma and Misconceptions in the Time of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Field Experiment in India,"A hidden cost of the COVID-19 pandemic is the stigma associated with the disease for those infected and groups that are considered as more likely to be infected. This paper examines whether the provision of accurate and focused information about COVID-19 from a reliable source can reduce stigmatization. We carry out a randomized field experiment in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, in which we provide an information brief about COVID-19 by phone to a random subsample of participants to address stigma and misconceptions. We find that the information brief decreases stigmatization of COVID-19 patients and certain groups such as religious minorities, lower-caste groups, and frontline workers (healthcare, police), and reduces the belief that infection cases are more prevalent among certain marginalized social and economic groups (Muslims, low caste, rural-poor population). We provide suggestive evidence that improved knowledge about the prevention and transmission of COVID-19 and reduced stress about the disease are important channels for these effects.",2021,,"Islam, Asad Pakrashi Debayan Vlassopoulos Michael Wang Liang"
Clinical characteristics and outcome of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in north india: A retrospective study,"Introduction: World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020, due to the constantly increasing number of cases outside China. Previously, India had global record of highest single day spike of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) cases, with 97,894 cases on 17th September 2020. Aim: To find out the demographic and clinical characteristics of critically ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 and comparing the outcomes of patients admitted in COVID dedicated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with and without co-morbidities and also in different age groups and sex.Material and Methods: This retrospective study from July 2020 to December 2020 was a single centre observational experience of management of COVID-19 patients at COVID dedicated ICU in Firozabad, India. The following data were recorded: Age, sex, comorbidities and mode of oxygen delivery (invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal canula). Chi-square test was used to compare the outcomes of patients admitted in COVID dedicated ICU with and without co-morbidities and also in different age groups and sex.Results: In this study, the data of 120 severely ill COVID-19 patients were reviewed. The mean age of patients were (58±15.29) years and male to female ratio was 3:1. At least one comorbid condition was reported in 53.3% of patients-most common being Hypertension (36.6%) followed by Diabetes mellitus 2 (20%), COPD (15%). Then Cardiovascular Diseases, Renal, Liver diseases and ailments followed. All patients admitted to COVID ICU had moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Older age (61 years and above, mortality 17%), male sex (16.7% deaths among 90 critically ill male COVID patients) and presence of comorbid conditions appear to have higher mortality in this study. However apart from comorbid conditions (p=0.001) none was statistically significant. The overall mortality in this study of 120 critically ill COVID patients was 14.16%.Conclusion: From this study, it can be suggested that survival of critically ill COVID patients can further be improved by better management of their comorbid conditions and avoiding complications of invasive ventilation. However, further multicentric studies with large sample size are needed to confirm these findings.",2021,Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,"Verma, R.; Nishad, R. K.; Patawa, R.; Kumar, A."

Criticizing green stimulus for COVID recovery,"Abstract Recent calls by world leaders recommend that policy responses to the COVID crisis incorporate ?green stimulus? or ?green recovery? as a vital element. In a 2014 article in this journal, we argued that green stimulus would be an inefficient way to either boost demand and restore full employment in the context of the global financial crisis or pursue long-run environmental goals. In this paper, we argue that the attempt to marry green and COVID recovery programs may prove an even less fitting response to the near-term crisis, while still threatening to put environmental policy on paths that prove inefficient in the long run. We argue that green stimulus/recovery, while yielding more long-term climate benefits, would likely generate a slower and smaller recovery in jobs and activity than a traditional macroeconomic stimulus. This creates a trade-off for policymakers. The global financial crisis provides our primary real-world experience of green stimulus/recovery policies. A small but growing number of ex post empirical studies suggest that these measures' near-term growth impact was less than expected or obtained at a relatively high cost. There is also a danger that orienting green programs toward near-term shocks like the global financial crisis and COVID could compromise public understanding of, political support for, and the quality of environmental and climate policies in the long run.

"COVID‐19 vaccines mix‐and‐match: The concept, the efficacy and the doubts","The search for developing effective vaccines against SARS‐CoV‐2 began with the start of the COVID‐19 pandemic, and the first vaccine dose was administered in December 2020. Today, full vaccination of most of the world's population is considered the most important means to overcome the COVID‐19 pandemic. Vaccination has been associated with various struggles. Some adverse reactions have resulted in the discontinuation of the specific vaccines use in some countries. Countries in poor regions have faced difficulties supplying enough vaccine doses, and the emergence of new variants of concern has resulted in reduced effectiveness of available vaccines against COVID‐19. The mix‐and‐match strategy, using heterologous vaccines in the first and second doses, might successfully solve the mentioned struggles. Moreover, this strategy has been associated with higher cellular and humoral immune responses without significantly increasing the adverse reactions. Hence, this strategy can help improve the vaccines' effectiveness, and act as a solution for vaccine shortage in poor regions.",2021-11-30,J Med Virol,"Rashedi, Ronak; Samieefar, Noosha; Masoumi, Niloofar; Mohseni, Sahar; Rezaei, Nima"
"Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis: clinical settings, antibiotic susceptibility, and visual outcomes","Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis is clinically more severe, more difficult to treat, and carry a higher risk of vision loss, evisceration, or enucleation. This study is to investigate the clinical settings, antibiotic susceptibility, and visual outcomes of S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan. S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 38 eyes of 38 patients. The main clinical features were postcataract endophthalmitis (n = 13, 34%) and endophthalmitis associated with corneal ulcer (n = 12, 32%), trauma (n = 6, 16%), endogenous etiology (n = 4, 11%), trabeculectomy (n = 2, 5%), and pterygium excision-related scleral ulcer (n = 1, 3%). Presenting visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to no light perception. Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics was performed in 17 eyes (39%) in primary or secondary treatments. S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (38/38, 100%), penicillin (37/38, 97%), ceftriaxone (37/38, 97%), cefuroxime (12/15, 80%), levofloxacin (13/15 ,87%), and moxifloxacin (15/17, 88%). Final visual acuity was better than 20/400 in 3 of 38 eyes (8%), 5/200 to hand motions in 3 eyes (8%), and light perception to no light perception in 32 eyes (84%). Ten eyes (26%) underwent evisceration or enucleation. Although S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis had a very poor visual prognosis.",2021,Sci Rep,"Chen, Kuan-Jen; Chong, Ying-Jiun; Sun, Ming-Hui; Chen, Hung-Chi; Liu, Laura; Chen, Yen-Po; Wu, Wei-Chi; Kang, Eugene Yu-Chuan; Lai, Chi-Chun"
Outcome of abdominal wall hernia repair with Permacol™ biologic mesh.,"The use of biologic mesh in abdominal wall operations has gained popularity despite a paucity of outcome data. We aimed to review the experience of a large healthcare organization with Permacol™. A retrospective study was conducted of patients who underwent abdominal hernia repair with Permacol™ in 14 Southern California hospitals. One hundred ninety-five patients were analyzed over a 4-year period. Operations included ventral/incisional hernia repairs, ostomy closures, parastomal hernia repairs, and inguinal hernia repairs. In 50 per cent of the patients, Permacol™ was used to reinforce a primary fascial repair and in 50 per cent as a fascial bridge. The overall complication rate was 39.5 per cent. The complication rate was higher in patients with infected versus clean wounds, body mass index (BMI) 40 kg/m(2) or greater versus BMI less than 40 kg/m(2), in patients with prior mesh repair, and when mesh was used as a fascial bridge. With a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, morbid obesity was associated with a higher recurrence. To date this is the largest study on the use of Permacol™ in abdominal wall hernia repair. In our patient population undergoing heterogeneous operations with a majority of wounds as Class II or higher, use of Permacol™ did not eliminate wound morbidity or prevent recurrence, especially in morbidly obese patients.",2013,The American surgeon,"Cheng, Amy W; Abbas, Maher A; Tejirian, Talar"

Predictors of mental health worsening among children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"Restrictions put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have significantly affected the lives of children and adolescents worldwide. School closure, home confinement and social distancing have the potential to negatively impact the mental health of this population. Several risk factors seem to contribute to worsening mental health of children and adolescents, with an increase of anxiety and depression symptoms. This review aims at exploring research available on risk factors that may worsen the mental health among children and adolescents during the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Some of these predictors in worsening the effects are social isolation, screen time and excessive social media use, parental stress and poor parent–child relationship, low socioeconomic status, preexisting mental health conditions and/or disabilities. SUMMARY: Further research is needed in order to understand mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as risk factors associated with negative consequences.

Self-Defeating Codes of Medical Ethics and How to Fix Them: Failures in COVID-19 Response and Beyond,"Statements of the core ethical and professional responsibilities of medical professionals are incomplete in ways that threaten fundamental goals of medicine. First, in the absence of explicit guidance for responding to cases in which there is significant uncertainty or disagreement about the relative therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic merits of available interventions they perpetuate self-defeating practices. Second, without addressing the role of advertising in shaping patient and community preferences they risk creating moral loopholes that bypass and undermine professional duties of fidelity, honesty and transparency. In both cases, these flaws are exacerbated by an individualism that ignores the critical role of health systems in managing and reducing uncertainty and conflict over best practices, and in communicating with and shaping the expectations of the public. These points are illustrated with examples from the response to COVID-19 and suggestions for reform are proposed.",2021,Am J Bioeth,"London, Alex John"

Investment timing and capacity choice in duopolistic competition under a jump-diffusion model,"This paper aims to apply the real options game theoretic to study the impact of sudden events on the optimal investment timing and capacity choice in a duopoly market. We model the market demand and investment cost as the geometric Brownian motions with jumps driven by the Poisson processes. A new computing method independent on specific distribution functions is proposed for the real option models with jump processes of random frequency and amplitude. Based on this method, we find that both firms delay investment with a larger capacity as uncertainties of demand and investment cost increase. We also demonstrate that two firms both invest later and the optimal capacity relationship between them is ambiguous in the presence of two sources of uncertainty. Numerical simulation reveals that upward (downward) jump in demand and downward (upward) jump in investment cost cause the firms to invest earlier (later) with a larger (smaller) capacity. Finally, in a duopoly with symmetric firms, the first investor invests earlier than in an asymmetric duopoly due to the threat of preemption.",2021-08-21,Math Finan Econ,"Wu, Xiaoqin; Hu, Zhijun"
"Polymerase-chain reaction testing to prevent hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Shinjuku, an epicenter in Tokyo: The Tokyo Women's Medical University model","Hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a healthcare challenge. We hypothesized that polymerase chain reaction testing of symptomatic triaged outpatients and all inpatients before hospitalization in Shinjuku, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter in Tokyo, using the Tokyo Women's Medical University (TMWU) model would be feasible and efficient at preventing COVID-19. This retrospective study enrolled 2981 patients from March to May 2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.81% (95% credible interval [CI]: 0.95-3.47%) in triaged symptomatic outpatients, 0.04% (95% CI: 0.0002-0.2%) in scheduled asymptomatic inpatients, 3.78% (95% CI: 1.82-7.26%) in emergency inpatients, and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.49-3.82%) in symptomatic patients. There were no cases of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has come of age: From a vaccine adjuvant to antiviral immunotherapy,"GM-CSF acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a key growth factor produced by several immune cells such as macrophages and activated T cells. In this review, we discuss recent studies that point to the crucial role of GM-CSF in the immune response against infections. Upon induction, GM-CSF activates four main signalling networks including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, MAPK, and NFκB pathways. Many of these transduction pathways such as JAK/STAT signal via proteins commonly activated with other antiviral signalling cascades, such as those induced by IFNs. GM-CSF also helps defend against respiratory infections by regulating alveolar macrophage differentiation and enhancing innate immunity in the lungs. Here, we also summarize the numerous clinical trials that have taken advantage of GM-CSF’s mechanistic attributes in immunotherapy. Moreover, we discuss how GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and how its activity is interfered with to reduce inflammation such as in the case of COVID-19. This review brings forth the current knowledge on the antiviral actions of GM-CSF, the associated signalling cascades, and its application in immunotherapy.",2021-01-09,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,"Petrina, Maria; Martin, Jacqueline; Basta, Sameh"
A systematic review of COVID-19 and obstructive sleep apnoea,"The aims of the study were to review the rapidly emerging COVID-19 literature to determine 1) the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and adverse COVID-19 outcomes and, 2) potential causal mechanisms 3) what effect COVID-19 has had on OSA diagnosis and 4) what effect COVID-19 has had on treatment and management of OSA during this period. PubMed was systematically searched up to 020620. Studies were included if they had examined the relationship between COVID-19 and OSA. Studies were included that were in English and had the full text available. The findings from this study suggest that many of the risk factors and co-morbidities associated for OSA which include obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. There are plausible mechanisms by which OSA may independently increase one's risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 and data from the newly published CORONADO study suggests that OSA treated patients may be at increased risk of death from COVID-19. It is clear that the pandemic has had a major effect on the treatment management and diagnosis of OSA and moving forward it may be necessary to explore new diagnosis and treatment pathways for these individuals.",2020,Sleep Med Rev,"Miller, Michelle A; Cappuccio, Francesco P"

Systematic Review on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: It Is Time to Take Stock,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population.

Implications derived from S-protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 from six continents,"Spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of the infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Several mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have already been detected, and their effect in immune system evasion and enhanced transmission as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality are being investigated. From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa had the highest percentage of unique S proteins (29.1%). The phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America are significantly different from those of the other five continents. They are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. It is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. It is also further suggested that the efficacy of existing vaccines and future vaccine development must be reviewed with careful scrutiny, and if needed, further re-engineered based on requirements dictated by new emerging S protein variants.",2021-09-24,Int J Biol Macromol,"Hassan, Sk.

Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (TIME) in home care services: a cluster randomized feasibility trial,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur frequently in people with dementia and can contribute to an increased need for help and a reduced quality of life, but also predict early institutionalization. The Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (TIME) might be a useful personalized approach to BPSD in people with dementia. The main objective of this feasibility trial was to explore the trial design and methods along with the patients’ and the home care staff’s acceptance of the TIME intervention before developing a definitive trial. Additionally, we wanted to explore whether TIME could be appropriate for staff in home care services in their approach towards people with dementia with anxiety and depression. METHODS: This was a 18-month feasibility trial using a parallel cluster randomized controlled design. Nine municipalities from the eastern part of Norway (clusters) — 40 people with dementia and 37 of their next of kin— were randomized to the TIME intervention or to treatment as usual. In addition, qualitative data as field notes were collected and summarized. RESULTS: The staff in home care services experienced TIME as an appropriate method; in particular, the systematic approach to the patient’s BPSD was experienced as useful. However, the completion of the assessment phase was considered exhaustive and time-consuming, and some of the staff found it challenging to find time for the case conferences. CONCLUSIONS: We consider that TIME, with some adjustments, could be useful for staff in home care services in cases where they face challenges in providing care and support to people with dementia. This feasibility trial indicates that we can move forward with a future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of TIME in people with dementia receiving home care services.

Designing the renewed European defence policy through permanent structured cooperation. Why?,"As the COVID-19 crisis has evidenced, Europe is currently facing non-traditional, hybrid threats and challenges to its public order and security that question traditional, stand-alone responses Conscious of this, during the last decade the European Union (EU) has developed several tools to deal with those security threats and challenges jointly by making full use of the Lisbon Treaty provisions Indeed, in addition to the strengthening of the policies and instruments of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), the EU has particularly boosted European defence cooperation within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since 2016 through initiatives such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PeSCo) The aim of these defence initiatives is twofold: on the one hand, to complement AFSJ instruments to protect the EU homeland and its citizens;on the other, to enhance its response to international crises and contribute to international peace and security A matter of future concern will be, nevertheless, to sustain the political momentum after the COVID-19 socioeconomic crisis and to show the positive externalities of enhancing defence cooperation in fighting non-traditional threats and challenges, notwithstanding the many difficulties that it will encounter in its uncertain path © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",2021,Defence Studies,"Ruiz Díaz, L.

Impact of the topology of metapopulations on the resurgence of epidemics rendered by a new multiscale hybrid modeling approach,"Abstract Simulating epidemics in metapopulations is a challenging issue due to the large demographic and geographic scales to incorporate. Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD–IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.",2011-07-31,Ecological Informatics,"Vincenot, Christian Ernest; Moriya, Kazuyuki"
"COVID-19-Associated Mucormycosis, A New Incident in Recent Time: Is An Emerging Disease in The Near Future Impending?","Mucormycosis (also known as black fungus) is caused by fungi of the Zygomycetes class and is the third most common invasive mycosis after candidiasis and aspergillosis. They colonize a large number of patients without invading them. Systemic glucocorticoids are currently used to treat severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). In such patients, opportunistic fungal infections are a problem. Although COVID-19-related pulmonary aspergillosis is becoming more common, mucormycosis is still uncommon. Mucormycosis normally appears 10 to 14 days after being admitted to the hospital. Mucormycosis is a rare but dangerous infection that can make extreme COVID-19 worse. Mucormycosis is more likely to occur in people who have diabetes mellitus and other risk factors. Mucormycosis is most likely exacerbated by concurrent glucocorticoid treatment. To improve outcomes, a high index of suspicion and aggressive management is required. Excessive usage of steroids, monoclonal antibodies, and broad-spectrum antibiotics might cause the formation or worsen of a fungal infection. A high index of suspicion and aggressive management are needed. In patients with COVID-19 infection, physicians should be vigilant of the likelihood of subsequent invasive fungal infections. To enhance results in pulmonary mucormycosis, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Confirmation of the clinical form necessitates a combination of symptoms that are consistent with tissue invasion histologically. Combining various clinical data and the isolation of the fungus from clinical samples in culture is needed for the probable diagnosis of mucormycosis. The organism that causes mucormycosis is identified using macroscopic and microscopic morphological criteria, carbohydrate assimilation, and the maximum temperature at which they can expand. Mucormycosis must be treated with antifungal medication prescribed by a doctor. It may necessitate surgery in some circumstances, and it can result in the loss of the upper jaw and, in some situations, an eye.",2021-12-02,Avicenna J Med,"Ray, Suman Kumar; Mukherjee, Sukhes"
Using serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to conserve PCR tests in a resource constrained combat environment,"Background: In March 2020, COVID-19 threatened combat operations in Afghanistan At that time, the NATO Resolute Support mission involved nearly 17,000 troops from 38 partner nations, plus civilians who support the mission, scattered throughout Afghanistan While Afghanistan did not initially report many confirmed cases, large numbers of cases were reported from neighboring countries with known migration across the borders (sometimes thousands/day) Military medical leaders advised commanders regarding the potential health risks to the force, balancing with risks to the mission Quarantine and isolation protocols were established Public health interventions of social distancing, cloth mask wear, enhanced environmental cleaning, active case finding, and emphasis on hand hygiene and cough etiquette were enforced However, many base locations were unable to alleviate close living quarters Testing was identified as a means to assess risk to the population Testing capabilities were limited, particularly PCR When this testing strategy was established, the utilization and interpretation of antibody tests was quite controversial With rapid antibody kits, the time to detection of both IgM and IgG are similar;detection of either cannot identify the time since exposure Methods: A novel surveillance plan was established whereby subpopulations at highest risk for exposure to the virus were screened with antibody tests from 17 Apr-1 Jun, 2020 High risk populations included: those leaving quarantine, base defense guards, isolation unit guards, medical personnel, dining facility workers, and those who interact with local populations Individuals with detectable antibody (either IgM or IgG) were further evaluated with PCR tests Results: In the first six weeks of this testing strategy, 1957 antibody tests were utilized A total of 37 specimens were identified antibody positives with seroprevalence of 2% (Figure 1) Thirteen were identified to have positive IgG, 22 with IgM, and 2 with both PCR was performed on those with detectable antibody, 13 (35%) had positive PCR Conclusion: Serosurveillance of populations at high risk for exposure to the virus is a logical way to conserve testing resources in a constrained combat environment (Table Presented)",2020,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,"White, B.

International trade in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,"This chapter overviews the relationship between international trade and the WTO law, international trade strategy, as well as labour standards, human rights, and the public health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. It is stated that the most effective way to overcome the crisis is timely and effective information-sharing since informed community can make better decisions on trade issues. The urgency of effective measures and implementation of new WTO regulations are believed to be vital for providing fair trade in the present circumstances. The right trade policies would not only revive the trade and recover the time lost to the crisis but would also shift toward a more sustainable and inclusive future. The author claims that, in view of the pandemic, the efforts of policymakers and business leaders to find ways to achieve trade balance should imply greater coherency between trade, labour standards, public health, and human rights objectives. © 2021, IGI Global.",2021,Impact of Infodemic on Organizational Performance,"Abuseridze, G."
Complications and mortality of cardiovascular emergency admissions during COVID-19 associated restrictive measures,"While hospital admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, controversy remains about respective complication and mortality rates This study evaluated admission rates, complications, and intrahospital mortality for selected life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies (MI, PE, and acute aortic dissection (AAD)) during COVID-19-associated restrictive social measures (RM) in Styria, Austria By screening a patient information system for International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) diagnosis codes covering more than 85% of acute hospital admissions in the state of Styria (~1 24 million inhabitants), we retrospectively identified patients with admission diagnoses for MI (I21, I22), PE (I26), and AAD (I71) Rates of complications such as cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treatment escalations (thrombolysis for PE), and mortality were analyzed by patient chart review during 6 weeks following onset of COVID-19 associated RM, and during respective time frames in the years 2016 to 2019 1,668 patients were included Cumulative admissions for MI, PE and AAD decreased (RR 0 77;p&lt;0 001) during RM compared to previous years In contrast, intrahospital mortality increased by 65% (RR 1 65;p = 0 041), mainly driven by mortality following MI (RR 1 80;p = 0 042) PE patients received more frequently thrombolysis treatment (RR 3 63;p = 0 006), while rates of cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation remained unchanged Of 226 patients hospitalized during RM, 81 patients with suspected COVID-19 disease were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection with only 5 testing positive Thus, cumulative hospital admissions for cardiovascular emergencies decreased during COVID-19 associated RM while intrahospital mortality increased",2020,PLoS One,"Bugger, H.; Gollmer, J.; Pregartner, G.; Wünsch, G.; Berghold, A.; Zirlik, A.; von Lewinski, D."
Ten golden rules to individualize mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Over the last decades, great strides have been made in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation remains the cornerstone of supportive therapy for ARDS. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation minimizes the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improves survival. Several parameters are determinants of VILI and require careful setting, such as tidal volume (VT), plateau pressure (Pplat), driving pressure (DP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate. Furthermore, measurement of energy and mechanical power may enable quantification of the relative contribution of its different components (VT, Pplat, ΔP, PEEP, respiratory rate, and airflow) and better individualize mechanical ventilation settings. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents is of interest, mainly in cases of severe ARDS, to improve oxygenation and reduce asynchrony; however, no significant changes in survival have been observed. Rescue respiratory therapies, such as prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal support techniques may also be used in specific situations. Furthermore, respiratory weaning protocols should be discussed. After reviewing all recent clinical trials, we now present 10 golden rules to individualize mechanical ventilation in ARDS management.",2021-03-01,,"Battaglini, Denise; Sottano, Marco; Ball, Lorenzo; Robba, Chiara; Rocco, Patricia R.M.; Pelosi, Paolo"

Nasal ciliated cells are primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 replication in the early stage of COVID-19,"The upper respiratory tract is compromised in the early period of COVID-19, but SARS-CoV-2 tropism at the cellular level is not fully defined. Unlike recent single-cell RNA-Seq analyses indicating uniformly low mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related host molecules in all nasal epithelial cells, we show that the protein levels are relatively high and that their localizations are restricted to the apical side of multiciliated epithelial cells. In addition, we provide evidence in patients with COVID-19 that SARS-CoV-2 is massively detected and replicated within the multiciliated cells. We observed these findings during the early stage of COVID-19, when infected ciliated cells were rapidly replaced by differentiating precursor cells. Moreover, our analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism was restricted to the nasal ciliated versus oral squamous epithelium. These results imply that targeting ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium during the early stage of COVID-19 could be an ideal strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 propagation.",2021,J. clin. invest,"Ahn, Ji Hoon; Kim, JungMo; Hong, Seon Pyo; Choi, Sung Yong; Yang, Myung Jin; Ju, Young Seok; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Ho Min; Rahman, M D Tazikur; Chung, Man Ki; Hong, Sang Duk; Bae, Hosung; Lee, Chang-Seop; Koh, Gou Young"
Hypothalamic-pituitary hormones will be affected by the interaction between 5q13-14-rs2239670 (CARTPT) gene variants and diet in different obesity phenotypes,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence show that cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript-prepropeptide (CART-PT) gene variants may affect obesity related traits, but little is known about its end points. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the interaction of CARTPT gene polymorphism with diet quality indices including dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) on cardio-metabolic risk factors. This cross sectional study recruited 288 apparently healthy obese individuals. Diet quality indices including DASH and MDS were evaluated using semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) was used for CARTPT genotypes. RESULTS: No significant differences was reported for general characteristics and biochemical parameters across genotypes except for QUICKI among females (P = 0.01) and it was higher in heterozygous genotype. There was significant CARTPT-DASH interactions affecting serum fasting glucose level (P = 0.049). However, in relation to CERTPT-MDS interactions, the highest level of insulin (P = 0.003) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.003) values were shown among AA carriers in high adherence to MDS, while AA carriers in high compliance to MDS experienced decreased level of QUICKI (P = 0.001).

Efficacy of Silene arenosa extract on acetylcholinesterase in Bungarus sindanus (krait) venom,OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of Silene arenosa extract on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of krait (Bungarus Sindanus) snake venom. METHODS: The present project designed to evaluate the inhibition of AChE by following standard procedures. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the results showed that Silene arenosa exerted 73% inhibition against the krait venom acetylcholinesterase at fixed substrate acetylcholine (ACh) concentration (0.5 mM). Kinetic analysis using the Lineweaver Burk plot revealed that Silene arenosa caused a competitive type of inhibition i.e. Km values increased from 26.6 to 93.3 mM (26.6% to 93.3%) and Vmax remained constant in a concentration-dependent manner. Silene arenosa competes with the substrate to bind at the active site of the enzyme. The Kmapp of venom AChE for Silene arenosa increased from 60% to 81.6% and the Vmaxapp remains constant. Ki (inhibition constant was estimated to be 48 µg for snake venom; while the Km (Michaelis-Menten constant of AChE- substrate into AChE and product) was estimated to be 0.5 mM. The IC50 of AchE calculated for Silene arenosa was 67 µg. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that Silene arenosa extract can be considered as an inhibitor of snake venom AChE.,2021,J Tradit Chin Med,"Shah, Adil; Ahmed, Mushtaq; Sher, Naila; Mushtaq, Nadia; Khan, Rahmat-Ali"
"Primary Care implementation of Germ Defence, a digital behaviour change intervention to improve household infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of randomising dissemination of the Germ Defence behaviour change website via GP practices across England UK. TRIAL DESIGN: A two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial implementing Germ Defence via GP practices compared with usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Setting: All Primary care GP practices in England. Participants: All patients aged 16 years and over who were granted access by participating GP practices. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: We will ask staff at GP practices randomised to the intervention arm to share the weblink to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice during the 4-month trial implementation period and care will otherwise follow current standard management. Germ Defence is an interactive website (http://GermDefence.org/) employing behaviour change techniques and practical advice on how to reduce the spread of infection in the home. The coronavirus version of Germ Defence helps people understand what measures to take and when to take them to avoid infection. This includes hand washing, avoiding sharing rooms and surfaces, dealing with deliveries and ventilating rooms. Using behaviour change techniques, it helps users think through and adopt better home hygiene habits and find ways to solve any barriers, providing personalised goal setting and tailored advice that fits users’ personal circumstances and problem solving to overcome barriers. Comparator: Patients at GP practices randomised to the usual care arm will receive current standard management for the 4-month trial period after which we will ask staff to share the link to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the effects of implementing Germ Defence on prevalence of all respiratory tract infection diagnoses during the 4-month trial implementation period. The secondary outcomes are: 1) incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses 2) incidence of COVID-19 symptom presentation 3) incidence of gastrointestinal infections 4) number of primary care consultations 5) antibiotic usage 6) hospital admissions 7) uptake of GP practices disseminating Germ Defence to their patients 8) usage of the Germ Defence website by individuals who were granted access by their GP practice RANDOMISATION: GP practices will be randomised on a 1:1 basis by the independent Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). Clinical Commission Groups (CCGs) in England will be divided into blocks according to region, and equal numbers in each block will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be generated in Stata statistical software by a statistician not otherwise involved in the enrolment of general practices into the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The principal investigators, the statistician and study collaborators will remain blinded from the identity of randomised practices until the end of the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): To detect planned effect size (based on PRIMIT trial, Little et al, 2015): 11.1 million respondents from 6822 active GP practices. Assuming 25% of these GP practices will engage, we will contact all GP practices in England spread across 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0, dated 13 January 2021. Implementation is ongoing. The implementation period started on 10 November 2020 and will end on 10 March 2021.

"Epidemiological Susceptibility Risk, Adaptive Management and Firm Performance","This paper uses firm-level information to analyse the impact of epidemic outbreak risk on individual firms’ performance. Its impact on performance materializes mainly through consumer perception of risk and the resilience of the supply chain networks. The extent to which countries are prepared to identify and respond to these risks adequately is a critical factor. We therefore construct an index of epidemiological susceptibility risk (ESR), which we use to predict business performance around the world. The index captures the role of infrastructure, demographics, economic activity and institutional governance. It proves a significant predictor of corporate sales growth. It also fares well in explaining business performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results remain robust to various sensitivity and endogeneity tests and after controlling for different non-economic and institutional factors. The ESR captures diverse conditions, which may amplify or contain the contagion of epidemiological risk, and therefore it could potentially be a useful tool for predicting and managing epidemic outbreaks and their consequences on business sustainability. © 2021 British Academy of Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,British Journal of Management,"Mertzanis, C."
Early experience with universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in a New York-based reproductive endocrinology ‎practice.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peak around March 2020 led to temporary closures of most fertility clinics. Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer.",2021-03-16,Systems biology in reproductive medicine,"Gingold, Julian A; Galperin, Sharon; Fowler, Sabrina; Kappy, Michelle; Pollack, Staci; Singh, Manvinder; Lieman, Harry; Jindal, Sangita"

Expanding Protection Motivation Theory to Explain Willingness of COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake among Taiwanese University Students,"Vaccination appears to be one of the effective strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the challenge of vaccine hesitancy may lower the uptake rate and affect overall vaccine efficacy. Being a low-risk group in terms of serious consequences of infection, university students may possess low motivation to get vaccinated. Therefore, an expanded Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) incorporating perceived knowledge, adaptive response, and maladaptive response was proposed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccination intention among Taiwanese university students. University students (n = 924; 575 males; mean age = 25.29 years) completed an online survey during January to February 2021. The proposed expanded PMT model was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that perceived knowledge was significantly associated with coping appraisal (standardized coefficient (β) = 0.820; p < 0.001), and coping appraisal was significantly associated with adaptive response (β = 0.852; p < 0.001), maladaptive response (β = 0.300; p < 0.001) and intention (β = 0.533; p = 0.009). Moreover, maladaptive response (β = −0.173; p = 0.001) but not adaptive response (β = 0.148; p = 0.482) was significantly and negatively associated with intention. The present study’s results demonstrated a positive path between perceived knowledge, coping appraisal, and intention among university students. Therefore, improving knowledge among this population may increase the intention to uptake the vaccine.",2021-09-19,Vaccines (Basel),"Huang, Po-Ching; Hung, Ching-Hsia; Kuo, Yi-Jie; Chen, Yu-Pin; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H."
Clinical pharmaceutical screening in critical situations in a radioiodine therapy management service.,"Radioiodine therapy can be used in differentiated thyroid carcinoma and requires extensive evaluation to ensure effectiveness and safety. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate all health problems and medications used in the pre-radioiodine therapy period and comprehensive medication managementservices can serve as a screening tool in this context. The present study aims to describe critical clinical situations identified during the initial assessments of a comprehensive medication management service offered to differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients pre-radioiodine therapy, and the pharmaceutical interventions performed to solve them. A descriptive study with regard to the initial ten months of a comprehensive medication management service was carried out in a large oncology hospital (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Descriptive analysis was used to describe the critical clinical situations identified, as well as the correspondent drug therapy problems and the type, acceptability, and outcomes of the pharmaceutical interventions performed to solve them. Thirty patients with an average of 45.8 years and 5.1 medications were evaluated. Five critical clinical situations were identified; corresponding to drug therapy problems two(needs additional drug therapy - n = 4) and drug therapy problems four (dosage too low - n = 1). All pharmaceutical interventions were accepted. The comprehensive medication management service provision pre-radioiodine therapy is feasible and represents an important screening strategy.",2021-10-18,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,"Fontes, Lídia Freitas; do Nascimento, Mariana Martins Gonzaga; Ramalho-de-Oliveira, Djenane; Rezende, Cristiane de Paula; Costa, Célia Helena Fernandes da; Melo, Rossana Corbo Ramalho de; Brunelli Pujatti, Priscilla"
A heart transplant after total artificial heart support: initial and long-term results.,"OBJECTIVES At our centre, the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) (SynCardia Systems, LLC, Tucson, AZ, USA) is used to provide long-term support for patients with biventricular failure as a bridge to a transplant. However, a heart transplant (HT) after such support remains challenging. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the immediate and long-term results following an HT in the cohort of patients who had a TAH-t implant. METHODS A total of 73 patients were implanted with the TAH-t between 1988 and 2019 in our centre. Of these 73 consecutive patients, 50 (68%) received an HT and are included in this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. RESULTS In the selected cohort, in-hospital mortality after an HT was 10% (n = 5). The median intensive care unit stay was 33 days (range 5-278). The median hospital stay was 41 days (range 28-650). A partial or total pericardiectomy was performed during the HT procedure in 21 patients (42%) due to a severe pericardial reaction. Long-term survival rates after an HT at 5, 10 and 12 years were 79.1 ± 5.9% (n = 32), 76.5 ± 6.3% (n = 22) and 72.4 ± 7.1% (n = 12), respectively, which was similar to the long-term survival for a primary HT without TAH-t during the same period (n = 686). An HT performed within 3-6 months post-TAH-t implantation appeared to provide the best survival (P = 0.007). Eight (16%) patients required chronic dialysis during the subsequent follow-up period, with 3 patients requiring a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS The long-term outcomes with the SynCardia TAH-t as a bridge to transplant in patients with severe biventricular failure are very encouraging. Our review noted that an HT following TAH-t can be technically challenging, especially in the case of a severe pericardial reaction, with potential pitfalls that should be recognized preoperatively.",2020-08-24,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,"David, Charles-Henri; Lacoste, Philippe; Nanjaiah, Prakash; Bizouarn, Philippe; Lepoivre, Thierry; Michel, Magali; Pattier, Sabine; Toquet, Claire; Périgaud, Christian; Mugniot, Antoine; Al Habash, Ousama; Petit, Thierry; Groleau, Nicolas; Rozec, Bertrand; Trochu, Jean Noel; Roussel, Jean Christian; Sénage, Thomas"
"SARS-CoV-2 detection using isothermal amplification and a rapid, inexpensive protocol for sample inactivation and purification","The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had an enormous impact on society worldwide, threatening the lives and livelihoods of many. The effects will continue to grow and worsen if economies begin to open without the proper precautions, including expanded diagnostic capabilities. To address this need for increased testing, we have developed a sensitive reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay compatible with current reagents, which utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 min. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was optimized to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. This simple inactivation and purification pipeline is inexpensive and compatible with other downstream RNA detection platforms and uses readily available reagents. It should increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.",2020,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Rabe, Brian A; Cepko, Constance"
Beyond Primary Care: Renewing the Community Health Center Vision for Today's Health Crisis,"United States community health centers address socioeconomic and environmental conditions and provide comprehensive primary care despite market forces that reinforce a medical model. Collaborating with 14 health center organizations, the RCHN Community Health Foundation promoted the original and broader health center vision of health, launching its population health management initiative in 2015. Although participating organizations were recognized as patient-centered medical homes and achieved rewards for quality, most identified gaps in their capacity for population health management. These challenges, addressed through peer learning and local initiatives, included engaging target populations, care coordination, socioeconomic and clinical data collection, and working with nontraditional local organizations. With relatively small funding, the zeal and enthusiasm for population health was revitalized among health center staff. The current pandemic and growing national concern for health disparities represents an opportunity to expand this broader vision of population health and to sustain it as the COVID-19 pandemic eventually subsides.",2022,J Health Care Poor Underserved,"Stevens, David M; Melinkovich, Paul; Jacobs, Feygele"
Community Resilience: A Dynamic Model for Public Health 3.0.,"OBJECTIVE To establish a model for Public Health 3.0 in order to define and measure community resilience (CR) as a method to measure equity, address structural racism, and improve population health. DESIGN To develop the CR model, we conducted a literature review in medicine, psychology, early childhood development, neurobiology, and disaster preparedness and response and applied system dynamics modeling to analyze the complex interactions between public systems, policies, and community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The CR model focuses on community and population health outcomes associated with the policies and practices of the housing, public education, law enforcement, and criminal justice sectors as CR measures. The model demonstrates how behaviors of these systems interact and produce outcome measures such as employment, homelessness, educational attainment, incarceration, and mental and physical health. RESULTS The policies and practices within housing, public schools, law enforcement, and criminal justice can suppress resilience for families and communities because they are shaped by structural racism and influence the character and nature of resources that promote optimal community health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS Community resilience is relational and place-based and varies depending on the demographic makeup of residents, historical patterns of place-based racism and discrimination, jurisdictional policy, and investment priorities-all influenced by structural racism. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE Using system dynamics modeling and the CR approach, chief health strategists can convene partners from multiple sectors to systematically identify, measure, and address inequities produced by structural racism that result in and contribute to adverse childhood and community experiences.",2022,Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,"Ellis, Wendy; Dietz, William H; Chen, Kuan-Lung Daniel"
The Role of Disaster Risk Governance for Effective Post-Disaster Risk Management—Case of Croatia,"Risk governance is mostly viewed through the lens of disaster or emergency management departments, agencies, or organizations. Visible in times of crises, risk governance is rarely seen as part of everyday public or private functions such as planning, social welfare, investments, or fiscal responsibilities. This paper emphasizes the importance of disaster risk governance in disaster risk management activities on the example of the post-disaster recovery of Croatia after a series of strong seismic events in mainland Croatia. The analysis is made based on a thorough review of national documents of Croatia and other selected countries overlapped with the national journals reporting on the situation from the affected areas. In accordance with the authors’ opinion, the necessary elements of disaster risk governance are clearly stated through the four Sendai framework priorities, and this statement is supported by the facts from the case study. Without either the political will or the enabling surrounding the disaster, risk management is next to impossible. The Croatian case study emphasizes the importance of disaster risk governance, showcasing the adaptation process for the post-disaster recovery process to start.",2022,Buildings,"Sigmund, Zvonko Radujković Mladen Atalić Josip"

Can ketone bodies inactivate coronavirus spike protein? The potential of biocidal agents against SARS-CoV-2,"Biocidal agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are able to inactivate several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this article, an insight into one mechanism for the inactivation of these viruses by those two agents is presented, based on analysis of previous observations during electron microscopic examination of several members of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily, including the new virus SARS-CoV-2. This inactivation is proposed to occur through Schiff base reaction-induced conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein leading to its disruption or breakage, which can prevent binding of the virus to cellular receptors. Also, a new prophylactic and therapeutic measure against SARS-CoV-2 using acetoacetate is proposed, suggesting that it could similarly break the viral spike through Schiff base reaction with lysines of the spike protein. This measure needs to be confirmed experimentally before consideration. In addition, a new line of research is proposed to help find a broad-spectrum antivirus against several members of this subfamily.",2021,Bioessays,"Shaheen, Alaa"
Stochastic modeling and estimation of COVID-19 population dynamics,The aim of the paper is to describe a model of the development of the Covid-19 contamination of the population of a country or a region. For this purpose a special branching process with two types of individuals is considered. This model is intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the contamination and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the contaminated individuals. This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the observed official statistics are not sufficient. In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered for different countries.,2020-04-02,,"Yanev, Nikolay M.; Stoimenova, Vessela K.; Atanasov, Dimitar V."
Neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 causing the worldwide pandemic has changed people’s life in multiple aspects dramatically since it’s first identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. While the numbers of infected patients and death toll keep vigorous increasing, curbing the progression of the pandemic is an urgent goal. Efforts have been made to search for prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including neutralizing antibodies development. By reviewing dozens of studies on anti-spike antibodies identification, we concluded that (1) promising therapeutic antibodies are being fished out by various approaches, such as screening of single B cells of convalescent patients, recombinant antibody library and B cells of immunized animals; (2) the epitopes are mainly RBD, but also some non-RBD domains, without the requisite of overlapping with ACE2 binding sites; (3) Neutralizing antibodies are convergent to a few germline genes, including IGHV3-30, IGHV3-53, IGHV3-66, with varying levels of somatic mutations. This review summarizes the progress in neutralizing antibodies development and the germline enrichment of effective antibodies, which will shed light on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design.",2020-12-15,Stem Cell Res,"Xiaojie, Shi; Yu, Li; lei, Yan; Guang, Yang; Min, Qiang"

Impact of PBP4 Alterations on β-Lactam Resistance and Ceftobiprole Non-Susceptibility Among Enterococcus faecalis Clinical Isolates,"Penicillin-resistance among Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates has been recently associated with overexpression or aminoacidic substitutions in low-affinity PBP4. Ceftobiprole (BPR), a new-generation cephalosporin, is a therapeutic option against E. faecalis. Here, we present evidence that pbp4 gene sequence alterations may influence the expression level of the gene and ceftobiprole binding to PBP4 in E. faecalis clinical isolates showing remarkable MDR-phenotypes, and how this could interfere with BPR in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activity. Seven E. faecalis strains from bloodstream infections were analyzed for their antibiotic and β-lactam resistance. BPR bactericidal activity was assessed by time-kill analysis; pbp4 genes were sequenced and pbp4 relative expression levels of transcription were performed by RT-qPCR. Five penicillin-resistant ampicillin-susceptible (PRAS) isolates were detected, 4 of which were also BPR non-susceptible (BPR-NS). In the time-kill experiments, BPR exposure resulted in a potent bactericidal activity (3-5 log(10) reduction) at the different concentrations tested. pbp4 gene sequence analysis revealed some mutations that may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase in the 4 BPR-NS strains (MICs 4-16 mg/L): the deletion of an adenine (delA) in the promoter region in all PRAS/BPR-NS strains; 12 different amino acid substitutions, 7 of which were next to the PBP catalytic-sites. The most significant were: T418A, located 6 amino acids (aa) upstream of the catalytic-serine included in the (424)STFK(427) motif I; L475Q, 7 aa upstream of the (482)SDN(484) motif II; V606A and the novel Y605H, 13/14 aa upstream of the (619)KTGT(622) motif III. Taken together, our data showed that elevated BPR MICs were attributable to increased transcription of pbp4 - associated with a single upstream adenine deletion and PBP4 alterations in the catalytic-site motifs – which might interfere with the formation of the BPR/PBP4 complex. pbp4 molecular alterations may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase, without affecting BPR cidal activity. Indeed, our in vitro dynamic analysis by time-kill assays showed that BPR exerted a bactericidal activity against E. faecalis clinical isolates, despite their MDR phenotypes.",2022-01-20,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Lazzaro, Lorenzo M.; Cassisi, Marta; Stefani, Stefania; Campanile, Floriana"

Reviewing the Role of the Endocannabinoid System in the Pathophysiology of Depression,"Major depressive disorder is a high-impact, debilitating disease and it is currently considered the most prevalent mental illness. It is associated with disability, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Despite its significant repercussions in our society, its exact pathophysiology remains unclear and therefore, available antidepressant treatment options are limited and, in some cases, ineffective. In the past years, research has focused on the development of a multifactorial theory of depression. Simultaneously, evidence supporting the role of the endocannabinoid system in the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric diseases has emerged. Studies have shown that the endocannabinoid system strongly impacts neurotransmission, and the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, which are known to be dysfunctional in depressive patients. Accordingly, common antidepressants were shown to have a direct impact on the expression of cannabinoid receptors throughout the brain. Therefore, the relationship between the endocannabinoid system and major depressive disorder is worth consideration. Nevertheless, most studies focus on smaller pieces of what is undoubtedly a larger mosaic of interdependent processes. Therefore, the present review summarizes the existing literature regarding the role of the endocannabinoid system in depression aiming to integrate this information into a holistic picture for a better understanding of the relationship between the two.",2021-12-06,Front Pharmacol,"Gallego-Landin, Ines; García-Baos, Alba; Castro-Zavala, Adriana; Valverde, Olga"
Evidence-based guideline: Antiepileptic drug selection for people with HIV/AIDS: report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Ad Hoc Task Force of the Commission on Therapeutic Strategies of the International League Against Epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE To develop guidelines for selection of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) among people with HIV/AIDS. METHODS The literature was systematically reviewed to assess the global burden of relevant comorbid entities, to determine the number of patients who potentially utilize AEDs and antiretroviral agents (ARVs), and to address AED-ARV interactions. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AED-ARV administration may be indicated in up to 55% of people taking ARVs. Patients receiving phenytoin may require a lopinavir/ritonavir dosage increase of ~50% to maintain unchanged serum concentrations (Level C). Patients receiving valproic acid may require a zidovudine dosage reduction to maintain unchanged serum zidovudine concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of valproic acid and efavirenz may not require efavirenz dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients receiving ritonavir/atazanavir may require a lamotrigine dosage increase of ∼50% to maintain unchanged lamotrigine serum concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir/atazanavir and lamotrigine may not require lamotrigine dosage adjustment (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir and midazolam may not require midazolam dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients may be counseled that it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary when other AEDs and ARVs are combined (Level U). It may be important to avoid enzyme-inducing AEDs in people on ARV regimens that include protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as pharmacokinetic interactions may result in virologic failure, which has clinical implications for disease progression and development of ARV resistance. If such regimens are required for seizure control, patients may be monitored through pharmacokinetic assessments to ensure efficacy of the ARV regimen (Level C).",2012,Neurology,"Birbeck, G L; French, J A; Perucca, E; Simpson, D M; Fraimow, H; George, J M; Okulicz, J F; Clifford, D B; Hachad, H; Levy, R H"
Molecular Epidemiology of Enterovirus in Children with Central Nervous System Infections,"Limited recent molecular epidemiology data are available for pediatric Central Nervous System (CNS) infections in Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of enterovirus (EV) involved in CNS infections in children. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children (0–16 years) with suspected meningitis–encephalitis (ME) who were hospitalized in the largest pediatric hospital of Greece from October 2017 to September 2020 was initially tested for 14 common pathogens using the multiplex PCR FilmArray(®) ME Panel (FA-ME). CSF samples positive for EV, as well as pharyngeal swabs and stools of the same children, were further genotyped employing Sanger sequencing. Of the 330 children tested with FA-ME, 75 (22.7%) were positive for EV and 50 different CSF samples were available for genotyping. The median age of children with EV CNS infection was 2 months (IQR: 1–60) and 44/75 (58.7%) of them were male. There was a seasonal distribution of EV CNS infections, with most cases detected between June and September (38/75, 50.7%). EV genotyping was successfully processed in 84/104 samples: CSF (n = 45/50), pharyngeal swabs (n = 15/29) and stools (n = 24/25). Predominant EV genotypes were CV-B5 (16/45, 35.6%), E30 (10/45, 22.2%), E16 (6/45, 13.3%) and E11 (5/45, 11.1%). However, significant phylogenetic differences from previous described isolates were detected. No unusual neurologic manifestations were observed, and all children recovered without obvious acute sequelae. Specific EV circulating genotypes are causing a significant number of pediatric CNS infections. Phylogenetic analysis of these predominant genotypes found genetic differences from already described EV isolates.",2021-01-13,Viruses,"Posnakoglou, Lamprini; Tatsi, Elizabeth-Barbara; Chatzichristou, Panagiota; Siahanidou, Tania; Kanaka-Gantenbein, Christina; Syriopoulou, Vasiliki; Michos, Athanasios"

285. Outcomes and Antibiotic Use in Patients with COVID-19 Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving empiric antibiotics (ABX) greatly exceeds those with culture-proven bacterial co-infections. However, the benefits of continuing ABX in culture-negative (CxN) cases is unknown; this practice may increase the risks associated with ABX overuse. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes and antibiotic use (AU) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 based on culture results. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study evaluating adults in an ICU for the first episode of ABX initiated following a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between September to December 2020. Blood and/or respiratory cultures must have been obtained within 24 hours (h) of ABX initiation. Patients were categorized into three groups: 1) CxN, ABX discontinued ≤ 72 h, 2) CxN, ABX continued > 72 h, or 3) Culture-positive (CxP). Data on AU was obtained from electronic medication administration records. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as being discharged alive or > 2-point decrease in the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale score from day of ABX initiation to day 30. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included with 35.4% being CxP. ABX were discontinued ≤ 72 h in 23.8% of CxN patients. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism in 52.2% of CxP patients (66.7% respiratory; 16.7% blood; 16.7% both). Anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and anti-pseudomonal antibiotics were the most prescribed for the initial regimen (Table 1). ABX de-escalation occurred in 58.5% of patients. Initial ABX duration was significantly longer in the CxP group (P < 0.01). No significant difference in clinical success was observed (Table 2). Although not significantly different, the highest rate of adverse events occurred in the CxN and ABX continued > 72 h group (40.6%). Table 1. Antibiotic Use in ICU Patients with COVID-19 [Image: see text] Table 2. Clinical Outcomes and Adverse Events in ICU Patients with COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In ICU patients with COVID-19, empiric broad-spectrum ABX are often overutilized with an inertia to de-escalate despite negative culture results, potentially increasing the risk of adverse events. This remains an important area for focused antimicrobial stewardship efforts to mitigate the development of multidrug resistance.

"How the cesarean delivery rate decreased at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Debrecen during the COVID-19 pandemic","Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: Az új koronavírus (SARS-CoV-2) okozta pandémia számos változást eredményezett életünk minden területén, így a debreceni Szülészeti és Nőgyógyászati Klinikán is. Célkitűzések: A koronavírus-járvány többek között a terminus körüli elektív szülésindukciók gyakorlatának megváltoztatását igényelte. A bevezetett új szakmai eljárásrendeknek, járványügyi intézkedéseknek, a megyei kórházi funkciót ellátó debreceni Kenézy Kórház Szülészeti Osztálya és a Szülészeti Klinika összevonásának, illetve a megváltozott jogi környezetnek a szülészeti ellátásra kifejtett együttes hatásait elemezzük. Módszerek: Helyi protokollokat és részletes eljárásrendeket készítettünk és vezettünk be. 1. Szülésindukció. 2. Szülésindukció cervixérlelést igénylő esetekben. 3. A szülés módjának megválasztása előzményi császármetszés után. 4. A császármetszés utáni hüvelyi szülést támogató, terminus körüli gondozási protokoll. A protokollok bevezetését követő első 9 hónap szülészeti mutatóit (szülésszám, császármetszések aránya, perinatalis kimenetel, szülésindukciók aránya és sikeressége) vizsgáltuk és hasonlítottuk össze a megelőző időszak debreceni adataival, illetve az országos szülészeti mutatókkal. Eredmények: Klinikánkon a császármetszés aránya 2020-ban 33,5%-ra csökkent, a protokollok bevezetése óta pedig 30,7%, miközben a 2020. évi magyarországi arány 40,3%. Az összes szülés 20%-a volt 2020-ban szülésindukció, melyek közül 74% végződött hüvelyi szüléssel, míg ugyanez 2019-ben 11% indukcióból 47%-nak adódott. A havi szülésszám 2020. január és 2021. január között folyamatosan emelkedett (250-ről 450-re), a havi császármetszési arány pedig 41%-ról 25%-ra csökkent. Mindezen változások mellett 2019-ről 2020-ra csökkent mind a perinatalis mortalitás (6,3‰-ről 4,2‰-re), mind a szülés után a Neonatalis Intenzív Centrumba történő felvételek aránya (14,8%-ról 13,5%-ra). Következtetések: A bemutatott tényezők együttes hatásaként - elsődlegesen a megfelelő és következetesen betartott protokolloknak köszönhetően - a szülésindukciók aránya és sikeressége jelentősen növekedett, a császármetszések aránya szignifikánsan csökkent, javuló perinatalis morbiditási és mortalitási mutatók mellett.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3‰ in 2019 to 4.2‰ in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

"Unexpected Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Air Quality in the Metro Atlanta, USA Using Ground-based and Satellite Observations","We studied the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) lockdown on the air quality over the Atlanta area using satellite and ground-based observations, meteorological reanalysis data and traffic information. Unlike other cities, we found the air quality has improved slightly over the Atlanta area during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown period (March 14–April 30, 2020), compared to the analogous period of 2019 (March 14-April 30, 2019). Ground NO2 concentrations have decreased slightly 10.8% and 8.2% over the near-road (NR) and urban ambient (UA) stations, respectively. Tropospheric NO2 columns have reduced 13%-49% over the Atlanta area from space-borne observations of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Ground ozone and PM2.5 have decreased 15.7% an ~5%, respectively. This slight air quality improvement is primarily caused by the reduced human activities, as COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced ~50% human activities, measured by traffic volume. Higher wind speed and precipitations also make the meteorological conditions favorable to this slight air quality improvement. We have not found a significant improvement in Atlanta amid the lockdown when human activities have reduced ~50%. Further studies are needed to understand the impacts of reduced human activities on atmospheric chemistry. We also found TROPOMI and ground measurements have disagreements on NO2 reductions, as collocated TROPOMI observations revealed ~23% and ~21% reductions of tropospheric NO2 columns over NR and UA stations, respectively. Several factors may explain this disagreement: First, tropospheric NO2 columns and ground NO2 concentrations are not necessarily the same, although they are highly correlated in the afternoon;Second, meteorological conditions may have different impacts on TROPMI and ground measurements. Third, TROPOMI may underestimate tropospheric NO2 due to uncertainties from air mass factors. Fourth, the uncertainties of chemiluminescence NO2 measurements used by ground stations. Consequently, studies using space-borne tropospheric NO2 column and ground NO2 measurements should take these factors into account.",2021,Aerosol and Air Quality Research,"Huang, Guanyu Ponder Reyla Bond Amber Hailey Brim Temeng Akua Naeger Aaron R.; Zhu, Lei"
"Inter-Species Cell Detection: Datasets on pulmonary hemosiderophages in equine, human and feline specimens","Pulmonary hemorrhage (P-Hem) occurs among multiple species and can have various causes. Cytology of bronchoalveolarlavage fluid (BALF) using a 5-tier scoring system of alveolar macrophages based on their hemosiderin content is considered the most sensitive diagnostic method. We introduce a novel, fully annotated multi-species P-Hem dataset which consists of 74 cytology whole slide images (WSIs) with equine, feline and human samples. To create this high-quality and high-quantity dataset, we developed an annotation pipeline combining human expertise with deep learning and data visualisation techniques. We applied a deep learning-based object detection approach trained on 17 expertly annotated equine WSIs, to the remaining 39 equine, 12 human and 7 feline WSIs. The resulting annotations were semi-automatically screened for errors on multiple types of specialised annotation maps and finally reviewed by a trained pathologists. Our dataset contains a total of 297,383 hemosiderophages classified into five grades.

COVID-19 vaccine willingness and cannabis use histories,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is associated with problematic health-behaviors such as excessive alcohol and tobacco use, and sedentary behavior. Here, we examined the association between cannabis use history and an especially topical health-behavior, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: COVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses. Those participants were compared to a group of 45 individuals with very light (<10) cannabis use histories who were propensity score-matched on age, sex, income, and race. Two-group t-tests and Bayes factor analysis on vaccine willingness were conducted between groups. Exploratory correlation analyses were conducted on vaccine willingness and lifetime cannabis use levels within the cannabis group only. RESULTS: Vaccine willingness did not differ between the two groups (t(88)=0.33, p=.74; BF(01)=4.3). However, a negative correlation was identified within the cannabis group, such that higher lifetime cannabis use histories correlated with less willingness to receive a vaccine (rho(43)= −.33, p=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccine willingness did not differ between the two matched groups, preliminary evidence suggests that heavy lifetime cannabis use might indicate a reluctance to engage in health-promoting behaviors like receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.",2021-04-28,medRxiv,"Spechler, Philip A.; Stewart, Jennifer L.; Kuplicki, Rayus; Paulus, Martin P."
NON-CONTACT SERVICE ROBOT DEVELOPMENT IN FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTs,"Given the prospect of low birth rate and aging population among developed countries, which further resulted in the shortage of workforces, service robots have been gradually applied to real-life from past academic research. This paper introduces the development of a service robot that is designed for food service in fast-food restaurants with the innovative improvement of mapping, localization, and navigation. Moreover, this research took the initiative of integrating 3D point cloud map and 2D occupancy grid map (OGM) in order to build a PC-OGM. In another word, using the sensory fusion method allows the service robot to adapt to a more complicated environment as well as enhance its positioning. In terms of its navigation function, the adaptive motion controller is refined so the service robot could navigate through narrow aisles smoothly. Finally, friendly contact-free food service robots were evaluated at fast-food restaurants in order to gain feedback from diners and waiters. Their feedback was broken down into 3 categories, availability, reliability, and satisfaction, for further analysis. As COVID-19 assails the world, we also look into future possibilities of food service robot deployment among restaurants to keep food and surface free from the virus.

Technological improvements in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC): A review of the literature and the SOLCA institutional experience in Neuro-Radiosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Neurosurgery is a medical field that requires specialized professionals and equipment, two important but scarce resources in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). Our goal was to report our experience with the replacement and implementation of linear accelerators with radiosurgery capabilities at SOLCA hospital in Quito, Ecuador and give some recommendations for future Technological replacements (TRs). Methods Two surveys were performed in SOLCA’s radiosurgery department, one before the TR was finalized and one after, consisting of an open and multiple-choice questionnaire. Questions focused on the performance of the new equipment, perceptions regarding the training, and the influence of the pandemic on the whole process. Additionally, we share our experience regarding the difficulties and benefits of TR at SOLCA. Results The most reported limitation was lack of training (48%). By the time of the second survey, 95.2% of the staff had already treated patients or planned a radio-surgical procedure;42.9% considered training to have been adequate, and 76.2% felt that the pandemic hindered the training process. Currently, 33 radiosurgeries have been done (26 for the central nervous system and 7 stereotactic radiation body therapies). Conclusion The TR in SOLCA had similarities with other experiences in LMIC, but the pandemic brought additional limitations, mainly complicating the staff training. Nevertheless, those limitations can be resolved with a structured training program and international collaboration. Overall, the benefits obtained from a TR result in exponentially better medical care and accessibility to novel treatments.",2022,World Neurosurgery,"Ochoa, Pamela Puente-Vallejo Raul Loza Felipe Cueva Fiorella Leon-Rojas Jose E."

Covid-19 Spaces Initiative Reduces Staff Exposure while Maintaining the Quality of Care,"Introduction and Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges to the healthcare system, with every patient contact a potential risk to staff This required rapid changes to traditional working methods in order to protect healthcare staff from virus exposure, reduce staff anxiety, and manage limited Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supplies We aimed to rapidly implement a new strategy for ward working, which would maintain high-quality patient care while reducing staff virus exposure and PPE consumption Methods We developed an integrated team working concept called SPACES (Shared Patient Assessments Cuts Exposure for Staff) to gain maximum benefit from every staff-patient contact, regardless of the individual's team role For example, a doctor undertaking a ward round would also perform observations, deliver meals, drinks and medication, and undertake procedures such as venesection, at one single visit saving patient contacts by other healthcare colleagues All staff applied the same principle for each patient contact We recorded individual staff entries into each bay (n=5) and side room (n=7) over 24 hours using the SPACES approach, and compared this to pre-SPACES estimates We also reviewed Ward patient and staff feedback pre- A nd post-SPACES Results We estimated that pre-SPACES there were 97 individual staff entries into a bay of 4 patients, and 36 into each side room, per 24 hours Using SPACES, we reduced this to a median [IQR] of 20 [12-22] entries per bay and 11 [10-16] entries per side room (p=0 06 and 0 02 respectively) This decreased PPE consumption by approximately 75% Patient satisfaction survey responses before and after implementing SPACES were unchanged Staff feedback on SPACES reflected high levels of satisfaction, increased sense of teamwork, and reduced anxiety of contracting COVID-19 Conclusions We showed that using the SPACES initiative in a COVID-19 ward decreased staff exposure to highly infectious patients, with resultant PPE use reductions, while maintaining a high standard of patient care and strengthening team spirit and staff morale Following our successful trial period, SPACES received support from the British Thoracic Society and the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Nursing It has been adopted throughout our trust, and by many centres internationally",2021,Thorax,"Poudel, A.; Essalmi, Y.; Desai, K.; Rehal, A.; Russell, R.; Shaw, S.; Bennett, J."
Single-dose mRNA therapy via biomaterial-mediated sequestration of overexpressed proteins,"Nonviral mRNA delivery is an attractive therapeutic gene delivery strategy, as it achieves efficient protein overexpression in vivo and has a desirable safety profile. However, mRNA's short cytoplasmic half-life limits its utility to therapeutic applications amenable to repeated dosing or short-term overexpression. Here, we describe a biomaterial that enables a durable in vivo response to a single mRNA dose via an ""overexpress and sequester"" mechanism, whereby mRNA-transfected cells locally overexpress a growth factor that is then sequestered within the biomaterial to sustain the biologic response over time. In a murine diabetic wound model, this strategy demonstrated improved wound healing compared to delivery of a single mRNA dose alone or recombinant protein. In addition, codelivery of anti-inflammatory proteins using this biomaterial eliminated the need for mRNA chemical modification for in vivo therapeutic efficacy. The results support an approach that may be broadly applicable for single-dose delivery of mRNA without chemical modification.",2020,Sci.

Protective measures undertaken during chest tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 outbreak,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease that was first reported in China and has become a worldwide pandemic. Many surgical procedures are continuing to be performed during this state of pandemic as is thoracic surgery. We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. METHODS: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment. RESULTS: There were a total of six patients enrolled in our study. All these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The surgical indication for the chest tube thoracostomy was tension pneumothorax in all six patents. All patients had lung expansion defects and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention. Unfortunately, all of them succumbed to COVID-19, despite best available treatment. There was no COVID-19 infection reported in the healthcare professionals during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic surgical procedures may cause dissemination of high amounts of 2019-nCoV in the environment and thus are perhaps the most dangerous surgeries to perform. Variations in the thoracic surgical techniques are necessary in order to protect the healthcare providers from COVID-19.",2020-11-24,Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,"Gedik, İsmail Ertuğrul; Alar, Timuçin"

The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c &#8805;7.0% at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomisation. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, p < 0.0006) and LOD (46%, p < 0.0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (p < 0.0035) in YOD and 24% (p < 0.0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well-tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns. In treatment-naïve patients with YOD (HbA1c 6.5-7.5%), early combination strategy improved attainment of glycaemic target with durability and delayed treatment escalation compared with initial metformin monotherapy.

"SARS-CoV-2 and the Eyes: A Review of the Literature on Transmission, Detection, and Ocular Manifestations","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous reports of ocular anomalies occurring in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. The most frequently reported pathology is conjunctivitis, which may be the first or only clinical manifestation of the disease. Involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in development of alterations in other ocular structures was suggested, including the cornea, the retina, and blood vessels. Possible mechanisms include direct activity of the viral agent, as well as systemic inflammatory response with accompanying thromboembolic complications. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in ocular secretions of infected individuals, including asymptomatic patients. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor protein used by the virus to enter the cell, has been found on the surface of various structures of the eye, which indicates a risk of transmission through ocular tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to use eye protection by medical professionals having contact with potentially infected patients. This paper is a review of the literature regarding ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a summary of the current state of knowledge about possibility of transmission from an ophthalmology point of view. For data collection, a thorough PubMed search was performed, using the key words: “COVID ocular”, “COVID eye”, “SARS-CoV-2 ocular”, and “SARS-CoV-2 eye”. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest itself in various ocular conditions. Eye protection should not be neglected, as recent studies suggest the eye as a potential route of transmission. Further search for adequate safety measures in ophthalmology practice is required.",2021-09-11,Med Sci Monit,"Szczęśniak, Michalina; Brydak-Godowska, Joanna"
Downregulation of Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in uveal melanoma patients.,"INTRODUCTION Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary eye tumour in adults. Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS . We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS >2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058). A similar trend, albeit not significant, was observed for disease-free survival (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS . Downregulated PLK-1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. It warrants further, multicentre research on prognostic role of PLK-1 expression and possibility of PLK-1 inhibition in uveal melanoma.",2020-06-30,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,"Berus, Tomasz; Markiewicz, Anna; Zwierzchowska, Katarzyna; Biecek, Przemyslaw; Orlowska-Heitzman, Jolanta; Romanowska-Dixon, Bozena; Donizy, Piotr"
Linear Sintonization of Two Cascade Vectorial Controllers from the Numerical Prediction of a Mechanical Ventilator System,"With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the demand of ventilators has increased to such an extent that there is not enough supply of equipment available For this reason, this research is based on an open source project presented by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which involves the conditioning of an Artificial Manual Breathing Unit (AMBU bag), that acts as an aid for patients to maintain a constant respiratory cycle This document presents the calculation of the control matrix for the mechatronic and bio pneumatic systems of the ventilator by implementing a Space-State Model that allows to obtain the control gains that may reduce the error concerning the open loop operation of the ventilator;furthermore, this paper also presents the SIMULINK simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of the calculated control matrixes Due to these graphic demonstrations, it was observed that the implemented controllers provided an increase in the response time and reduced the error, thus, theoretically, both controllers must provide stability and a higher performance to the ventilator prompting an appropriate assistance to the hospitalized victims of the COVID-19;however, currently, this project is not viable, as it has not been tested in real life and it does not meet the quality and medical requirements for its use in emergencies © 2020 IEEE",2020,"IEEE Int.

Identifying challenges in neurofibromatosis: a modified Delphi procedure,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis (SWN) are rare conditions with pronounced variability of clinical expression. We aimed to reach consensus on the most important manifestations meriting the development of drug trials. The five-staged modified Delphi procedure consisted of two questionnaires and a consensus meeting for 40 NF experts, a survey for 63 patient representatives, and a final workshop. In the questionnaires, manifestations were scored on multiple items on a 4-point Likert scale. The highest average scores for NF experts deciding the ‘need for new treatment’ were for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) (4,0) and high grade glioma (HGG) (3,9) for NF1; meningioma (3,9) for NF2 and pain (3,9) for SWN. The patient representatives assigned high scores to all manifestations, with plexiform neurofibroma being highest in NF1 (4,0), vestibular schwannoma in NF2 (4,0), and pain in SWN (3,9). Twelve experts participated in the consensus meeting and prioritised manifestations. MPNST was ranked the highest for NF1, followed by benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours. Tumour manifestations received highest ranking in NF2, and pain was the most prominent problem for SWN. Patient representative ratings for NF1 were similar to the experts’ opinions, except that they ranked HGG as the most important manifestation. For NF2 and SWN, the patient representatives agreed with the experts. We conclude that NF experts and patient representatives consent to prioritise development of drug trials for MPNST, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours, cutaneous manifestations and HGG for NF1; tumours for NF2; and pain for SWN.",2021-04-26,Eur J Hum Genet,"Dhaenens, Britt A.

Tidal volume measurement error in pressure control modes of mechanical ventilation: A model study.,"UNLABELLED Tidal volume (VT) measurement during pressure control (PC) ventilation with preset inspiratory time may produce errors due to patient inspiratory effort. We evaluated VT error in 3 common ICU ventilators. METHODS Simulated patient: 60kg adult with ARDS using IngMar Medical ASL 5000 having moderate inspiratory effort. Ventilators evaluated: Covidien PB 840, Maquet Servo-i, and Dräger Evita XL, PC breaths at preset inspiratory time (TI) 0.6-1.4s. VT error was defined as ventilator displayed VT minus the simulator displayed VT (mL/kg or % of true). RESULTS Relaxation of inspiratory effort caused flow reversal (exhalation) during TI, which led to VT error. For the PB 840, VT error was proportional to TI (maximum -2.0mL/kg, -19%). For the Servo-i, VT error was not related to TI (maximum error -0.2mL/kg or -1.2%). Volume error for Evita XL was not related to TI (maximum error was -0.7mL/kg or -6%). CONCLUSIONS Calculation of VT as the integral of flow over the preset inspiratory time rather than the period between zero crossings of flow may result in underestimation of both inhaled and exhaled volumes. The size of VT error can be large enough to potentially affect patient outcomes on some ventilators.",2016,Computers in biology and medicine,"Chatburn, Robert L; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Sasidhar, Madhu"

Telesurgery and Robotics: An Improved and Efficient Era,"Telesurgery, or remote surgery, is widely known as a master-slave technology. It has achieved a milestone in surgical technology and intervention, providing widespread prospects of operating on a patient in a remote area with increased accuracy and precision. It consists of one or more arms controlled by a surgeon and a master controller in a remote area accessing all the information being transferred via a telecommunication system. This paper reviews the present advancements and their benefits and limitations in the field of telesurgery. A handful of operations have been done so far. However, due to time-lag (latency), global networking problems, legal issues and skepticism, and on top of the cost of robotic systems and their affordability have led to the concept of telerobotics and surgery to lag. However, with more information and high speed, 5G networking, which has been in a trial to reduce latency to its minimum, is beneficial. Haptic feedback technology in telesurgery and robotics is another achievement that can be improved; further, this allows the robotic arms to mimic the natural hand movements of the surgeon in the control center so that the master controller can perform surgeries with more dexterity and acuity. Due to coronavirus (COVID-19), this type of surgery approach can reduce the probability of contracting the virus, saving more lives and the future.",2021-03-26,Cureus,"Mohan, Anmol; Wara, Um Ul; Arshad Shaikh, Muhammad Taha; Rahman, Rahil M; Zaidi, Zain Ali"
Bioactive Phytochemical Constituents of Wild Edible Mushrooms from Southeast Asia,"Mushrooms have a long history of uses for their medicinal and nutritional properties. They have been consumed by people for thousands of years. Edible mushrooms are collected in the wild or cultivated worldwide. Recently, mushroom extracts and their secondary metabolites have acquired considerable attention due to their biological effects, which include antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and immunomodulatory activities. Thus, in addition to phytochemists, nutritionists and consumers are now deeply interested in the phytochemical constituents of mushrooms, which provide beneficial effects to humans in terms of health promotion and reduction of disease-related risks. In recent years, scientific reports on the nutritional, phytochemical and pharmacological properties of mushroom have been overwhelming. However, the bioactive compounds and biological properties of wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asian countries have been rarely described. In this review, the bioactive compounds isolated from 25 selected wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asia have been reviewed, together with their biological activities. Phytoconstituents with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities have been highlighted. Several evidences indicate that mushrooms are good sources for natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agents",2020-04-23,Molecules,"Thu, Zaw Min; Myo, Ko Ko; Aung, Hnin Thanda; Clericuzio, Marco; Armijos, Chabaco; Vidari, Giovanni"
"COVID-19 Screening by Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seropositivity: Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Food Intake Quality","Developing countries have reported lower molecular diagnostic testing levels due to a lack of resources. Therefore, antibody tests represent an alternative to detect exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze possible risk factors. We aimed to describe and compare the clinical-epidemiological characteristics and the quality of food intake in Mexican individuals with a positive or negative test to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We carried out antibody tests and applied a survey to 1799 individuals; 42% were positive, and diabetes was more prevalent in these cases (p < 0.01). No differences were identified in the blood type nor influenza vaccination between groups. Coughing, respiratory distress, muscle pain, joint pain, and anosmia were the most prevalent symptoms among seropositive cases (p < 0.0001). Food intake quality was similar in both groups, except for the most consumed type of fat (p = 0.006). In conclusion, this study supports the association of diabetes as a principal risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. The results do not support previous associations between blood group or influenza vaccination as protective factors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, frequent consumption of polyunsaturated fats is highlighted as a new possible associated factor with COVID-19, which more studies should corroborate as with all novel findings.",2021-08-26,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Macedo-Ojeda, Gabriela; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco; Yokogawa-Teraoka, Patricia; Machado-Sulbarán, Andrea Carolina; Loza-Rojas, María Guadalupe; García-Arredondo, Atziri Citlally; Tejeda-Constantini, Rafael; Vega-Magaña, Alejandra Natali; González-Estevez, Guillermo; García-Chagollán, Mariel; Zepeda-Nuño, José Sergio; Hernández-Bello, Jorge"

"Urinary incontinence and sedentary behaviour in nursing home residents in Osona, Catalonia: protocol for the OsoNaH project, a multicentre observational study","INTRODUCTION: Several studies have shown that physical activity (PA) levels and sedentary behaviour (SB) are independent risk factors for many health-related issues. However, there is scarce evidence supporting the relationship between SB and urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling older adults, and no information on any possible association in institutionalised older adults. Stage I of this project has the main objective of determining the prevalence of UI and its associated factors in nursing home (NH) residents, as well as analysing the association between UI (and its types) and SB. Stage II aims to investigate the incidence and predictive factors of functional and continence decline, falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among NH residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Stage I is an observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study with mixed methodology that aims to explore the current status of several health-related outcomes in NH residents of Osona (Barcelona, Spain). The prevalence ratio will be used as an association measure and multivariate analysis will be undertaken using Poisson regression with robust variance. Stage II is a 2-year longitudinal study that aims to analyse functional and continence decline, incidence of falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these outcomes. A survival analysis using the actuarial method for functional decline and continence, evaluated every 6 months, and the Kaplan-Meier method for falls, hospitalisations and deaths, and Cox regression for multivariate analysis will be undertaken. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received the following approvals: University of Vic - Central University of Catalonia Ethics and Research Committee (92/2019 and 109/2020), Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Osona Foundation for Health Research and Education (FORES) (code 2020118/PR249).

How COVID-19 Is Testing and Evolving Our Communication Skills,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, as health care professionals and members of the general public, to adapt. Simple things we take for granted have become more difficult. As pressures increased for health care professionals, conversations and decisions have become tougher. This brought the need to adapt working practices and find ways to continue providing compassionate patient-centred care remotely. In UK radiotherapy departments, radiation therapist (review radiographer)-led clinics moved to telephone-based clinics to reduce the time spent by patients in a hospital environment. This required setting up a ""virtual"" clinic room with patients by removing distractions and setting boundaries for the conversation. We have had to adapt our communication skills quickly as picking up on nonverbal cues is not possible through the phone. It can be challenging to understand feelings through the tone of a patient's voice and empathise accordingly. The pandemic has forced patients to slow down and really focus on themselves which has led to picking up physical and mental health changes earlier. This is one of the many positive outcomes that can be drawn from the pandemic. Although we have changed how we work, ultimately we are still here to help our patients.",2020,Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),"Julka-Anderson, Naman"
"Which Melbourne Metropolitan Areas Are Vulnerable to COVID-19 Based on Age, Disability, and Access to Health Services? Using Spatial Analysis to Identify Service Gaps and Inform Delivery","Aging adults (65+) with disability are especially vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and on contracting, they are a cohort most likely to require palliative care. Therefore, it is very important that health services-particularly health services providing palliative care-are proximately available. Treating the Melbourne metropolitan area as a case study, a spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of aging adults (65+) with disability and high barriers to accessing primary health services. Afterward, travel times from priority areas to palliative medicine and hospital services were calculated. The geographic dispersion of areas with people vulnerable to COVID-19 with poor access to palliative care and health services is clarified. Unique methods of health service delivery are required to ensure that vulnerable populations in underserviced metropolitan areas receive prompt and adequate care.

Nuevos diagnósticos de diabetes mellitus tipo 1 en niños durante la pandemia COVID-19. Estudio multicéntrico regional en España,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine whether during the year 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus in children compared to the previous 2 years. It is also to find out if lockdowns and the difficulty providing face-to-face care in the health system have led to children showing more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational multicenter study of the province of Tarragona where data is collected from new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in patients under the age of 15 during the year 2020 and compared with years 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes during 2020 was 37 cases compared to 2019 and 2018 which was 23 and 29 respectively. The median age at onset was 9 years, 54% males. There was an increase in new diagnoses in the range of 10 to14-year-olds, with a decrease in the range of 0 to 4 year-olds. In 2020, the incidence in the group of patients with families from the Maghreb area rose from 52.2 cases per 100,000 population/year (c/10(5) p-y) in 2019 to 135.8 in 2020. Compared to the previous year, 2020 showed a significant decrease of ketoacidosis at the onset. None of the patients was diagnosed with COVID-19 during admission. CONCLUSION: During the year 2020 concurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics. Contrary to expectations, the presentation did not worsen by decreasing the proportions of ketoacidosis at onset. This data would suggest that, although attendance in the different health facilities dropped drastically during the year 2020 at the expense of virtual consultations, health systems and families were able to detect the symptoms of the disease early.",2022-02-14,Endocrinol Diabetes Nutr,"Hernández Herrero, María; Terradas Mercader, Pilar; Latorre Martinez, Ester; Feliu Rovira, Albert; Rodríguez Zaragoza, Neus; Parada Ricart, Ester"
Smart delivery and retrieval of swab collection kit for COVID-19 test using autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are one of the highly emerging technologies of the modern day. Due to their small size, flying capabilities, and complex machinery, drones can be deployed in diverse fields, including agriculture, sports, entertainment, parcel delivery, disaster management, search and rescue, emergency medicine, and healthcare. In case of medical emergency, timely delivery of the required emergency kit is very important. This is often not possible in many underdeveloped countries due to lack of resources, traffic jams, congestion or challenging routes. Also, in times like today’s when the world is hit with COVID-19 pandemic, the movement is very limited due to lockdowns and emergency. In such case, drones can be deployed to deliver the emergency kits and collect samples for tests. This may save someones life as well as time and financial resources. In third world countries, the COVID-19 has spread chaos because of very limited hospitals, resources and staff. Therefore, it is difficult for the government and health officials to accommodate every patient or give him/her the care that he/she needs. Amidst the fear of pandemic, everyone is trying to undergo tests for COVID-19 which is difficult to handle In our research, we have proposed a solution that comprises smartphone application with the help of a patient sending a call to a healthcare centre for delivering emergency kit. The kit contains equipment with the help of which a person can collect swab. The drone takes the swab samples back to the healthcare centre for tests. We have introduced an optimization factor as a baseline for future studies of this kind. We have further conducted field experiments to test our proposed scheme. The results have shown that drones can be quite efficient in collecting samples and delivering emergency kits.",2021-07-05,Physical Communication,"Saeed, Fahad; Mehmood, Amjad; Majeed, Muhammad Faran; Maple, Carsten; Saeed, Khalid; Khattak, Muhammad Kashif; Wang, Huihui; Epiphaniou, Gregory"
Oxytocin reverses ethanol consumption and neuroinflammation induced by social defeat in male mice,"Oxytocin (OXT) modulates social interactions, attenuates stressful responses and can decrease drug-seeking and taking behaviors. In previous studies, we observed that social defeat (SD) induced a long-lasting increase in ethanol intake and neuroinflammation in male mice. We also know that OXT blocks the increase in cocaine reward induced by SD. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the effect of 1â¯mg/kg of OXT administered 30â¯min before each episode of SD on ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory response in adult male mice. Three weeks after the last SD, mice underwent oral ethanol self-administration (SA) procedure, and striatal levels of the two chemokines CX3CL1 and CXCL12 were measured after the last SD and at the end of the ethanol SA. OXT administration blocked the increase in voluntary ethanol consumption observed in defeated mice, although it did not affect motivation for ethanol. An increase in the striatal levels of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 was observed in defeated animals immediately after the last defeat and after the ethanol SA. However, defeated mice treated with OXT did not show this increase in the neuroinflammatory response. In conclusion, OXT treatment can be a powerful therapeutic target to reduce the negative effects of social stress on ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory process.",2020,Horm Behav,"Reguilón, M D; Ferrer-Pérez, C; Miñarro, J; Rodríguez-Arias, M"
SARS-CoV-2 Infection Rates Following Use of Regular Compared With Defective Respirators When Caring for COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Follow-up Study,"BACKGROUND: There is strong observational evidence that respirators are highly effective in protecting the users from being infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but the evidence for SARS-CoV-2 during daily work is limited. This study utilized a subset of healthcare workers' temporary use of a new brand respirator with frequent defects when caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to assess the protective effect of regular respirators against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We retrospectively followed 463 participants wearing a regular respirator and 168 wearing the new brand respirator day-by-day when caring for COVID-19 patients until testing polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 27th December 2020 and 14th January 2021. RESULTS: We observed seven and eight incident SARS-CoV-2-infected cases. This corresponded with daily infection rates of 0.2 and 0.5%, an incidence rate ratio of 0.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1; 1.0], and an incidence rate difference of 0.3% (95% CI -0.1; 0.8) when comparing a regular with the new brand respirator.

Complex Reporting of the COVID-19 Epidemic in the Czech Republic: Use of an Interactive Web-Based App in Practice,"BACKGROUND: The beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic dates back to December 31, 2019, when the first cases were reported in the People's Republic of China. In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population. METHODS: The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization. RESULTS: The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.",2020,J Med Internet Res,"Komenda, Martin; Bulhart, Vojtech; Karolyi, Matej; Jarkovský, Jirí; Muzík, Jan; Májek, Ondrej; Snajdrová, Lenka; Ruzicková, Petra; Rázová, Jarmila; Prymula, Roman; Macková, Barbora; Brezovský, Pavel; Marounek, Jan; Cerný, Vladimír; Dusek, Ladislav"
The viral spike protein is not involved in the polarized sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells.,"Coronaviruses are assembled by budding into a pre-Golgi compartment from which they are transported along the secretory pathway to leave the cell. In cultured epithelial cells, they are released in a polarized fashion; depending on the virus and cell type, they are sorted preferentially either to the apical domain or to the basolateral plasma membrane domain. In this study, we investigated the role of the coronavirus spike protein, because of its prominent position in the virion the prime sorting candidate, in the directionality of virus release. Three independent approaches were taken. (i) The inhibition of N glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in the synthesis of spikeless virions. The absence of spikes, however, did not influence the polarity in the release of virions. Thus, murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) was still secreted from the basolateral membranes of mTAL and LMR cells and from the apical sides of MDCK(MHVR) cells, whereas transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was still released from the apical surfaces of LMR cells. (ii) Spikeless virions were also studied by using the MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutant Albany 18. When these virions were produced in infected LMR and MDCK(MHVR) cells at the nonpermissive temperature, they were again preferentially released from basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. (iii) We recently demonstrated that coronavirus-like particles resembling normal virions were assembled and released when the envelope proteins M and E were coexpressed in cells (H. Vennema, G.-J. Godeke, J. W. A. Rossen, W. F. Voorhout, M. C. Horzinek, D.-J. E. Opstelten, and P. J. M. Rottier, EMBO J. 15:2020-2028, 1996). The spikeless particles produced in mTAL cells by using recombinant Semliki Forest viruses to express these two genes of MHV-A59 were specifically released from basolateral membranes, i.e., with the same polarity as that of wild-type MHV-A59. Our results thus consistently demonstrate that the spike protein is not involved in the directional sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells. In addition, our observations with tunicamycin show that contrary to the results with some secretory proteins, the N-linked oligosaccharides present on the viral M proteins of coronaviruses such as TGEV also play no role in viral sorting. The implications of these conclusions are discussed.",1998,Journal of virology,"Rossen, J W; de Beer, R; Godeke, G J; Raamsman, M J; Horzinek, M C; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J"
How Did a Change in Regulatory Guidance regarding the AstraZeneca Vaccine impact Vaccine Hesitancy? A Repeated Cross-Section Event Study from the UK,"On April 7th 2021 the UK regulator recommended against delivering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine (AZ vaccine) to those under-30 if an alternative vaccine could be offered instead. The news followed deaths arising from blood clots and a suspension of use of the AZ vaccine by various other countries. The story became headline news and online search querying vaccine safety increased. What happened to Covid-19 vaccine intentions and attitudes? I collected relevant data the day after the story hit the front page. I asked UK adults if they intended to get the vaccine and measured their attitudes towards it ( after revision period : n = 502). I compare these data against two previous waves that used precisely the same methods of data collection (see Comerford et al., 2021). The first was taken before stories linking the AZ vaccine to bloodclots had been reported (baseline period: March 12th -15th ;n = 241). The second was taken after the AZ bloodclot story led EU countries to suspend use of the vaccine but before UK regulator changed guidance ( before revision period : March 17th ;n = 305). The data show no change in intentions or attitudes in the sample as a whole, nor in the subgroups who we would expect to be most affected by the UK regulators’ guidance (under-30s and those aged 30–40).",2021,,"Comerford, David"

Cervical screening during the COVID-19 pandemic: optimising recovery strategies,"Disruptions to cancer screening services have been experienced in most settings as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.",2021,Lancet Public Health,"Castanon, Alejandra; Rebolj, Matejka; Burger, Emily Annika; de Kok, Inge M C M; Smith, Megan A; Hanley, Sharon J B; Carozzi, Francesca Maria; Peacock, Stuart; O039,; Mahony, James F"
A drug-free nanozyme for mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an incurable disease of the gastrointestinal tract with a lack of effective therapeutic strategies. The proinflammatory microenvironment plays a significant role in both amplifying and sustaining inflammation during IBD progression. Herein, biocompatible drug-free ceria nanoparticles (CeNP-PEG) with regenerable scavenging activities against multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) were developed. CeNP-PEG exerted therapeutic effect in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis murine model, evidenced by corrected the disease activity index, restrained colon length shortening, improved intestinal permeability and restored the colonic epithelium disruption. CeNP-PEG ameliorated the proinflammatory microenvironment by persistently scavenging ROS, down-regulating the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, restraining the proinflammatory profile of macrophages and Th1/Th17 response. The underlying mechanism may involve restraining the co-activation of NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways. In summary, this work demonstrates an effective strategy for IBD treatment by ameliorating the self-perpetuating proinflammatory microenvironment, which offers a new avenue in the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.",2022-03-04,Journal of nanobiotechnology,"Zeng, Feng; Shi, Yahong; Wu, Chunni; Liang, Jianming; Zhong, Qixin; Briley, Karen; Xu, Bin; Huang, Yongzhuo; Long, Manmei; Wang, Cong; Chen, Jian; Tang, Yonghua; Li, Xinying; Jiang, Mengda; Wang, Luting; Xu, Qin; Yang, Liu; Chen, Peng; Duan, Shengzhong; Xie, Jingyuan; Li, Cong; Wu, Yingwei"

Advances and highlights in allergic rhinitis.,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a growing public health, medical and economic problem worldwide. The current review describes the major discoveries related to AR during the past two years; including risk factors for the prevalence of AR, the corresponding diagnostic strategy, precise underlying immunological mechanisms, as well as efficient therapies for AR during the ongoing global ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) pandemic. The review further attempts to highlight future research perspectives. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental exposures, climate changes and lifestyle are important risk factors for AR. Consequently, detailed investigation of the exposome and the connection between environmental exposures and health in the future should provide better risk profiles instead of single predictors, and also help mitigate adverse health outcomes in allergic diseases. Although patients with dual AR, a newly defined AR phenotype, display perennial and seasonal allergens-related nasal symptoms, they are only allergic to seasonal allergens, indicating the importance of measuring inflammation at the local sites. Herein, we suggest that a combination of precise diagnosis in local sites and traditional diagnostic methods may enhance the precision medicine-based approach for management of AR; however this awaits further investigations. Apart from traditional treatments, social distancing, washing hands, and disinfection are also required to better manage AR patients in the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in understanding the immune mechanisms underlying the effects of allergen immunotherapy (AIT), further understanding changes of cell profiles after AIT and accurately evaluate the efficacy of AIT are required.",2021-08-11,Allergy,"Zhang, Yuan; Lan, Feng; Zhang, Luo"
Identification environnementale d’agents pathogènes: Retex COVID-19 et perspectives,"Contrairement à la plupart des agents chimiques qui manifestent leurs effets sur l’organisme quelques heures après l’exposition, les agents pathogènes se caractérisent par une période d’incubation avant leur expression clinique conduisant à un retard à l’identification d’un phénomène infectieux collectif. Par ailleurs si dans le domaine chimique et radiologique il existe de nombreux appareils de détection pouvant être mis en œuvre sur le terrain, les capacités sont beaucoup plus réduites dans le domaine biologique. Cette nécessité de disposer d’une capacité d’analyse environnementale d’agents pathogènes a été identifiée précocement par le Bataillon de marins-pompiers de Marseille (BMPM) et l’émergence de la crise sanitaire liée à la COVID-19 a permis le développement de procédés innovants ouvrant à terme de nouvelles perspectives. S’appuyant sur l’expertise en prélèvements des personnels armant le VDIP (véhicule détection identification prélèvements) le BMPM s’est associé à un laboratoire de biotechnologies en capacité d’analyser par RT-PCR les échantillons fournis à la recherche de présence d’ARN de SARS-CoV-2. L’objectif initial était d’avoir une cartographie de la présence virale dans les emprises du BMPM et de s’assurer de l’efficience des procédures de bionettoyage. Une fois les techniques fiabilisées et les seuils de détection affinés cette capacité opérationnelle a été proposée à la ville de Marseille, aux Armées et acteurs institutionnels. Fort de cette technicité et de cette expérience le BMPM a acquis des PCR pouvant être embarquées à bord du VDIP. Cette capacité ouvre des perspectives intéressantes dans le cadre du spectre des menaces biologiques. En effet, à condition de disposer des amorces spécifiques des agents de la menace biologique, il sera ainsi possible suite à une revendication ou une découverte suspecte de pouvoir répondre rapidement sur la présence ou pas des agents de la menace directement sur site. Unlike pathogens defined by an incubation period preceding their clinical expression, biological warfare agents affect the body within hours of exposure. This may delay the identification of a collective infectious phenomenon. Many detection devices can be used in chemical and radiological hazards, but few options exist in biological hazard. The need for skills to analyse pathogens in the environment was early identified by the BMPM (Marseille navy fire battalion); and the Covid-19 health crisis enabled innovative processes and opened up new perspectives. Thanks to the expertise of ‘VDIP’ (vehicle for detection, identification and sampling) technicians, the BMPM collaborated with a biotechnology lab to analyse by RT-PCR the provided samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The main goals were to map the virus’ presence in the BMPM grounds and to ensure the bio cleaning procedures efficiency. Once the techniques were considered as reliable, and once the detection limits were assessed, this operational capability was proposed to the city of Marseille, to the French Army and to institutional stake holders. With these skills and experience, the BMPM acquired on-board PCR devices in the VDIP. This skill opens up interesting perspectives in the biological hazard field. Indeed, with a specific biological threat PCR primer, it will thus be possible to quickly assess the presence of on-site biological warfare agents in case of any suspicious activity.",2021-03-30,,"Beaume, Sébastien; Cazes, Nicolas; Peduzzi, Frank; Augier, Patrick"
Social Isolation and Nursing Leadership in Long-term Care: Moving Forward after COVID-19,"Nursing leaders have a responsibility to promote and facilitate social engagement and connectedness to mitigate social isolation in long term care (LTC).

The pandemic has shed light on the severe deleterious effect of social isolation and the critical importance of maintaining social engagement and connectedness, especially in times of crisis or major change. Staff education and ongoing support cannot be overemphasized. Critical nursing leadership and interdisciplinary collaboration, engaging all team members are essential in operationalizing non-pharmacological approaches that foster the well-being of residents with dementia.

Destruction of DNA-binding proteins by programmable O’PROTAC: Oligonucleotide-based PROTAC,"DNA-binding proteins including transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in gene transcription and DNA replication and repair during normal organ development and pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity, deeming to be a large repertoire of attractive therapeutic targets. However, this group of proteins are generally considered undruggable as they lack an enzymatic catalytic site or a ligand binding pocket. PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology has been developed by engineering a bifunctional small molecule chimera to bring a protein of interest (POI) to the proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus inducing the ubiquitination of POI and further degradation through proteasome pathway. Here we report the development of Oligonucleotide-based PROTAC (O’PROTACs), a class of noncanonical PROTACs in which a TF-recognizing double-stranded oligonucleotide is incorporated as a binding moiety of POI. We demonstrate that O’PROTACs of ERG and LEF1, two highly cancer-related transcription factors selectively promote degradation of these proteins and inhibit their transcriptional activity in cancer cells. The programmable nature of O’PROTACs indicates that this approach is applicable to destruct other TFs. O’PROTACs not only can serve as a research tool, but also can be harnessed as a therapeutic arsenal to target DNA binding proteins for effective treatment of diseases such as cancer.",2021-03-09,bioRxiv,"Shao, Jingwei; Yan, Yuqian; Ding, Donglin; Wang, Dejie; He, Yundong; Pan, Yunqian; Yan, Wei; Kharbanda, Anupreet; Li, Hong-yu; Huang, Haojie"
Lentiviral vector induces high-quality memory T cells via dendritic cells transduction,"We report a lentiviral vector harboring the human β2-microglobulin promoter, with predominant expression in immune cells and minimal proximal enhancers to improve vector safety. This lentiviral vector efficiently transduces major dendritic cell subsets in vivo. With a mycobacterial immunogen, we observed distinct functional signatures and memory phenotype in lentiviral vector- or Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-immunized mice, despite comparable antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell magnitudes. Compared to Ad5, lentiviral vector immunization resulted in higher multifunctional and IL-2-producing CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, lentiviral vector immunization primed CD8(+) T cells towards central memory phenotype, while Ad5 immunization favored effector memory phenotype. Studies using HIV antigens in outbred rats demonstrated additional clear-cut evidence for an immunogenic advantage of lentiviral vector over Ad5. Additionally, lentiviral vector provided enhance therapeutic anti-tumor protection than Ad5. In conclusion, coupling lentiviral vector with β2-microglobulin promoter represents a promising approach to produce long-lasting, high-quality cellular immunity for vaccinal purposes.",2021-06-10,Commun Biol,"Ku, Min Wen; Authié, Pierre; Nevo, Fabien; Souque, Philippe; Bourgine, Maryline; Romano, Marta; Charneau, Pierre; Majlessi, Laleh"
Integrating the Veterinarian Scientist to the One Health Concept,"One health is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working together to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. One health is thus at the intersection of human, animal, and environment health, and in the one health paradigm, these three different domains merge into one superposed and universal goal. The number of outbreaks around the world is increasing, in terms of total number and diversity of outbreaks and the richness of pathological agents. Identifying the origin of these outbreaks is important to ensure appropriate capacity to respond to potentially pandemic threats. Many (re-)emerging pathogens come from animals, and there is a compelling need to understand the epidemiology of these diseases, including the role of animals as disease reservoirs. In parallel, the progressive phasing out of antibiotics in animal foods around the world has been achieved through active collaboration of physicians and veterinarians, and it is to be hoped that this continued interaction will help align human and veterinary medicine with the objectives of the one health paradigm. Indeed, a multi-sector cooperative approach between human and veterinarian health will contribute to improved preparedness and capacity for response to current and future health threats using the one health concept.",2019-02-02,Adult Vaccinations,"Moro, Manuel"
Osteoarthritis guidelines: a progressive role for topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.,"Current treatment guidelines for the treatment of chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis reflect the collective clinical knowledge of international experts in weighing the benefits of pharmacologic therapy options while striving to minimize the negative effects associated with them. Consideration of disease progression, pattern of flares, level of functional impairment or disability, response to treatment, coexisting conditions such as cardiovascular disease or gastrointestinal disorders, and concomitant prescription medication use should be considered when creating a therapeutic plan for a patient with osteoarthritis. Although topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs historically have not been prevalent in many of the guidelines for osteoarthritis treatment, recent evidence-based medicine and new guidelines now support their use as a viable option for the clinician seeking alternatives to typical oral formulations. This article provides a qualitative review of these treatment guidelines and the emerging role of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a therapy option for patients with localized symptoms of osteoarthritis who may be at risk for oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related serious adverse events.",2013,Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,"Stanos, Steven P"

Data-driven Contact Network Models of COVID-19 Reveal Trade-offs between Costs and Infections for Optimal Local Containment Policies,"While several non-pharmacological measures have been implemented for a few months in an effort to slow the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, the disease remains a danger in a number of counties as restrictions are lifted to revive the economy. Making a trade-off between economic recovery and infection control is a major challenge confronting many hard-hit counties. Understanding the transmission process and quantifying the costs of local policies are essential to the task of tackling this challenge. Here, we investigate the dynamic contact patterns of the populations from anonymized, geo-localized mobility data and census and demographic data to create data-driven, agent-based contact networks. We then simulate the epidemic spread with a time-varying contagion model in ten large metropolitan counties in the United States and evaluate a combination of mobility reduction, mask use, and reopening policies. We find that our model captures the spatial-temporal and heterogeneous case trajectory within various counties based on dynamic population behaviors. Our results show that a decision-making tool that considers both economic cost and infection outcomes of policies can be informative in making decisions of local containment strategies for optimal balancing of economic slowdown and virus spread.",2021-04-03,,"Fan, Chao; Jiang, Xiangqi; Lee, Ronald; Mostafavi, Ali"

Respiratory viruses in HIV-infected patients with suspected respiratory opportunistic infection.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence and epidemiological pattern of respiratory viruses in HIV-infected patients and to evaluate their potential clinical impact. DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted at three Swiss university hospitals. Study participants were HIV-infected patients who underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out an opportunistic event. All bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were screened using a set of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 different respiratory viruses. RESULTS Between November 2003 and November 2006, 59 bronchoalveolar episodes from 55 HIV-infected patients were analysed. Eleven of 59 episodes (18.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in three cases (27.3%) followed by influenza A in two (18.2%). Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, bocavirus, human rhinovirus A and human metapneumovirus were each identified in one case (9%). In the majority of these cases (63.6%) no other concomitant microorganism was isolated.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is a rare complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that may appear at any stage of the disease. In this case, AIDP represents a late presentation of HIV infection. METHODS Descriptive study. Patient data were collected from their medical records and by health assessment interviews. RESULTS We report a case of a 52-year-old male with acute lower limb weakness. Given the suggestive clinical presentation of AIDP and a positive HIV test, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with antiretroviral therapy. Progressive weakness to the upper limbs, autonomic dysfunction, and pain was observed. The second regimen of IVIG plus corticosteroids was administered. Muscle strength improved after three weeks.

"Whose health is it, anyway?","The health of nations has never been a more pressing concern for governments and societies around the world as it is today. Even before the pandemic began, our ageing and growing populations, living with more co-morbidities, presented significant challenges to health systems and economies globally. This book is therefore both timely and relevant to the single most important issue of today and tomorrow-our collective health. It provides unique analysis of the challenges facing the public's health today, furnished with examples, illustrations and innovative proposals for moving forward and transforming our health. Fresh insights into why our health matters to each of us both individually and collectively as society, are put forward-although we are living longer, more of these years are spent in poor health and this will continue to impact more people in years to come. In characteristic style, the chapters harness a vision for positive change by going much further than just diagnosing the problem;they dissect the drivers (making the point that our health is not inevitable, these are not 'determinants') of the wider health environment through novel approaches. This encompasses well described social drivers of health, to more novel commercial drivers of health, capturing both how they drive the world and the environment that we live in. They also draw on the positive commercial drivers of old as demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The book focuses on the healthcare system. Their vision of transforming healthcare systems from 'importers of illness to exporters of health' is supported by the compelling case of the potential reward in achieving this goal, and the imperative to do so, alongside pragmatic, yet innovative, approaches that embrace emerging technologies and data analytics.

Barriers to employment for refugees seeking work in the Australian construction industry: an exploratory study,"Purpose>In Australia, as in many other countries, refugees are over-represented in the ranks of the unemployed, under-employed and precariously employed and often become frustrated in their attempts to secure work. Despite the construction industry being a major potential source of employment for refugees, there has been a surprising lack of research into their experiences of securing work in the industry. Addressing this gap and also the general lack of voice for refugees in construction research, the aim of this paper is to explore the barriers refugees face in securing employment in the construction industry.Design/methodology/approach>This paper reports a survey of refugees who have worked or attempted to seek work in the Australian construction industry.Findings>Results show that the main barriers to securing employment in construction are: lack of local work experience;employer discrimination;employer failure to recognise previous qualifications, skills and experience and employers not understanding the challenges they face. Government employment agencies and systems are also perceived to be of limited value and overly complex, in contrast to the activities of not-for-profit support agencies.Research limitations/implications>While the research is limited to Australia, the findings contribute an important and missing refugee dimension to the emerging body of research on construction social procurement. They also contribute unique sector-specific insights into the broader debate about refugee resettlement and employment. Further research is needed in other national contexts.Practical implications>Recommendations are made to address the barriers to employment identified including: initiatives to provide refugees with work experience in the industry;education to break-down negative stereotypes of refugees among employers;greater support for not-for-profits supporting refugees and reform of government and employment agency systems and procedures.Social implications>By enhancing understanding of the barriers to employment for refugees in construction and proposing solutions to reduce those barriers, this research contributes new insights into a growing global challenge of how we better integrate growing numbers of refugees into harmonious and prosperous societies.Originality/value>The findings are important in facilitating the smoother integration of refugees into society. Beyond the moral imperative, there are significant social, cultural and economic benefits which successful refugee integration brings to host countries and industries like construction which in many countries are now being required to employ refugees in their workforce as a condition of public sector contracts.",2022,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management","Loosemore, Martin Alkilani Suhair Z.; Ahmed, W.

Immunotherapy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associated with human papillomavirus in the covid-19 pandemic. Clinicians’ view,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the connection between SARS-CoV-2 and other immune-dependent human conditions, including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), are being discussed. A review of the literature and the results of observation of patients who are currently receiving therapy with inosine pranobex (IP) according to the standard regimen (as the second stage after organ-preserving cervical surgery) indicate the absence of any abnormalities during the postoperative period. Moreover, publications on the interaction of IP and COVID-19 provide a chance for a favorable outcome regarding not only the treatment of CIN, but also minimizing the inflammatory syndrome in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion. The use of IP as medication-assisted (postoperative) treatment of patients with CIN-HPV in the COVID-19 pandemic conditions is, firstly, as effective with respect to cervical pathology as it is outside the pandemic;secondly, in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it can potentially reduce the severity of the course and consequences of respiratory viral infection.",2021,"Voprosy Ginekologii, Akusherstva i Perinatologii","Davydov, A.

Antibody-induced conformational changes in herpes simplex virus glycoprotein gD reveal new targets for virus neutralization.,"As the receptor-binding protein of herpes simplex virus (HSV), gD plays an essential role in virus entry. In its native state, the last 56 amino acids of the ectodomain C terminus (C-term) occlude binding to its receptors, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and nectin-1. Although it is clear that movement of the C-term must occur to permit receptor binding, we believe that this conformational change is also a key event for triggering later steps leading to fusion. Specifically, gD mutants containing disulfide bonds that constrain the C-term are deficient in their ability to trigger fusion following receptor binding. In this report, we show that two newly made monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), MC2 and MC5, have virus-neutralizing activity but do not block binding of gD to either receptor. In contrast, all previously characterized neutralizing anti-gD MAbs block binding of gD to a receptor(s). Interestingly, instead of blocking receptor binding, MC2 significantly enhances the affinity of gD for both receptors. Several nonneutralizing MAbs (MC4, MC10, and MC14) also enhanced gD-receptor binding. While MC2 and MC5 recognized different epitopes on the core of gD, these nonneutralizing MAbs recognized the gD C-term. Both the neutralizing capacity and rate of neutralization of virus by MC2 are uniquely enhanced when MC2 is combined with MAb MC4, MC10, or MC14. We suggest that MC2 and MC5 prevent gD from performing a function that triggers later steps leading to fusion and that the epitope for MC2 is normally occluded by the C-term of the gD ectodomain.",2012,Journal of virology,"Lazear, Eric; Whitbeck, J Charles; Ponce-de-Leon, Manuel; Cairns, Tina M; Willis, Sharon H; Zuo, Yi; Krummenacher, Claude; Cohen, Gary H; Eisenberg, Roselyn J"

The Prospect of Lactoferrin Use as Adjunctive Agent in Management of SARS-CoV-2 Patients: A Randomized Pilot Study,"Background and Objectives: Preventive, adjunctive and curative properties of lactoferrin have been evaluated since the first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a viral respiratory disease, emerged 18 years ago. Despite the discovery of new vaccine candidates, there is currently no widely approved treatment for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Strict adherence to infection prevention and control procedures, as well as vaccines, can, however, prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lactoferrin treatment in improving clinical symptoms and laboratory indices among individuals with mild to moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Materials and Method: A randomized, prospective, interventional pilot study conducted between 8 July and 18 September 2020 used a hospital-based sample of 54 laboratory-confirmed participants with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Randomization into a control and two treatment groups ensured all groups received the approved Egyptian COVID-19 management protocol; only treatment group participants received lactoferrin at different doses for seven days. Clinical symptoms and laboratory indices were assessed on Days 0, 2 and 7 after starting treatments. Mean values with standard deviation and one-way analysis of variance with least significant difference of demographic and laboratory data between control and treatment groups were calculated. Results: Our study showed no statistically significant difference among studied groups regarding recovery of symptoms or laboratory improvement. Conclusions: Further research into therapeutic properties particularly related to dosage, duration and follow-up after treatment with lactoferrin in individuals with COVID-19 is required.",2021-08-19,Medicina (Kaunas),"Algahtani, Fahad Dhafer; Elabbasy, Mohamed Tharwat; Samak, Mai A.; Adeboye, Adeniyi A.; Yusuf, Rafeek A.; Ghoniem, Mohamed E."
COVID-19 and Lockdown: The Potential Impact of Residential Indoor Air Quality on the Health of Teleworkers,"In addition to outdoor atmospheric contamination, indoor exposure to pollutants is a prime contributor to the overall human exposure, and may condition the expressiveness and severity of respiratory, cardiovascular, and allergic diseases. This situation has worsened due to COVID-19, as people have spent more time indoors to comply with social isolation and mandatory telework. The primary purpose of this study was to assess and compare indoor air quality (IAQ) in a significant sample of dwellings of workers from a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in Portugal who were teleworking and their usual workplace. The levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde, particles with equivalent diameters of less than 10 μm, 5 μm, 2.5 μm, 1 μm, 0.5 μm, and 0.3 μm, and ultrafine particles, as well as the level of thermal comfort, were measured at both of the sites assessed. It was found that most of the houses studied, as well as the HEI, had good IAQ, although there were places where the concentrations of some pollutants were above the legal standards. On the other hand, a link was identified between the IAQ and the symptoms and diseases observed in the workers who participated in the study. These results offer the opportunity to make corrective interventions, thereby controlling the sources of pollutants and promoting better ventilation in order to reduce the risk for workers.",2022-05-17,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Ferreira, Ana; Barros, Nelson"
Evaluation of the Safety of Ketorolac in Postsurgical Infants Less Than Six Months of Age.,"OBJECTIVE Ketorolac-related adverse events are not yet elucidated in neonates and infants given paucity of data. The objective of this research is to determine the incidence of major bleed in postsurgical neonates and infants treated with ketorolac, and to describe characteristics of ketorolac therapy and its effect on renal function. METHODS This retrospective review assessed postsurgical patients younger than 6 months of age, without renal and/or coagulation dysfunction, who received ketorolac for postoperative pain during the study period. Major bleed was defined as a decrease in hemoglobin by ≥ 2 g/dL in a 24-hour period and/or intracranial, intraventricular, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Renal injury was identified per pediatric-modified RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end stage renal disease) criteria. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients were analyzed, having a mean dosing weight of 5.6 kg, gestational age of 37.2 weeks, and postnatal age of 3.8 months. Ketorolac therapy was most frequently 0.5 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours with a mean of 6.7 doses administered. The primary endpoint of major bleed occurred in 2 (1.6%) 2-month-old patients of 39 weeks' gestation. Both bleeds were characterized by decrease in hemoglobin without evidence of clinically significant bleeding. One (0.8%) and 3 (2.4%) patients experienced a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and urine output, respectively. Sixty-two (49.6%) patients received a concomitant medication associated with decreased bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS Ketorolac appears to have low incidence of major bleeds in postsurgical patients younger than 6 months of age without renal and/or coagulation dysfunction. Larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm safety of ketorolac use in this population.",2022,The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG,"McElroy, Nicole A; Bustin, Anna; Gattoline, Sarah"

M3Lung-Sys: A Deep Learning System for Multi-Class Lung Pneumonia Screening from CT Imaging,"To counter the outbreak of COVID-19, the accurate diagnosis of suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine, medical treatment, and preventing the spread of the pandemic. Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System (M3Lung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3 Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks. More importantly, the generated lesion location maps make our system interpretable and more valuable to clinicians.",2020,,"Qian, Xuelin Fu Huazhu Shi Weiya Chen Tao Fu Yanwei Shan Fei Xue Xiangyang"
Carbohydrate Microarrays,"Carbohydrates, like nucleic acids and proteins, are essential biological molecules. Owing to their intrinsic physicochemical properties, carbohydrates are capable of generating structural diversity in a multitude of ways and are prominently displayed on the surfaces of cell membranes or on the exposed regions of macromolecules. Recent studies highlight that carbohydrate moieties are critical for molecular recognition, cell-cell interactions, and cell signaling in many physiological and pathological processes, and for biocommunication between microbes and host species. Modern carbohydrate microarrays emerged in 2002 and brought in new high-throughput tools for “glyco code” exploration. In this section, some basic concepts of sugar chain diversity, glyco-epitope recognition, and the evolving area of glyco-epitomics and biomarker discovery are discussed. Two complementary technologies, carbohydrate antigen arrays and photogenerated glyco-chips, serve as models to illustrate how to apply carbohydrate microarrays to address biomedical questions.",2015-06-01,Polysaccharides,"Wang, Denong; Tang, Jin; Wolfinger, Russell D.; Carroll, Gregory T."
Improving Risk Management in a Scaled Agile Environment,"Agile methods are designed for handling uncertainty as well as reducing risks in product development through transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Applying an effective risk management is in the nature of agile methods. However, when multiple agile teams work on the same product, a higher coordination effort is required and more formal practices are applied. The objective of this paper is to study how risk management can be improved in a scaled agile environment. Therefore, we conducted a case study in a large-sized ecommerce company and interviewed several project managers. The results show that there are differences for risk management in terms of two contexts. On the one hand, informal risk management is rated as good enough for one autonomous team. On the other hand, more formal approaches are needed, when several teams work on the same requirement. Furthermore, a tool for the support of risk management in a scaled agile environment is presented. We can conclude that hybrid development approaches consisting of agile practices and traditional practices, are beneficial, when several teams work in parallel.",2020-05-06,Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,"Schön, Eva-Maria; Radtke, Dirk; Jordan, Christian"

Frequency and Correlates of Online Consultations With Doctors or Therapists in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Nationally Representative Cross-sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: A few studies have identified the frequency and correlates of online consultations with doctors or therapists. However, there is a lack of studies using nationally representative data from middle-aged and older adults in Germany. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the frequency and correlates of online consultations with doctors or therapists in Germany. METHODS: For this study, cross-sectional data were taken from the nationally representative German Ageing Survey (DEAS; n=3067 in the analytical sample; age range 46-98 years). As part of the DEAS, a short survey was conducted between June 8 and July 22, 2020, examining the everyday life and living conditions among these middle-aged and older individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of online consultations with doctors or therapists served as the dependent variable (daily, several times a week, once a week, 1-3 times a month, less often, and never). Multiple logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS: In sum, 10.02% (381/3806) of individuals with access to the internet had online consultations with doctors or therapists. Multiple logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of using online consultations with doctors or therapists (compared with those never using such services) was positively associated with higher education (compared with medium education; odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), living with a partner in the same household (compared with single; OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.22), poorer self-rated health (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16-1.74), increased loneliness (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), and increased satisfaction with life (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that a non-negligible proportion of about 1 out of 10 individuals aged 46 years and over had online consultations with doctors or therapists. However, compared with other countries, this proportion remains small. Knowledge about the correlates of (non)use may assist in identifying corresponding individuals. In times of reshaping the health care system, these efforts in online consultations with doctors or therapists may contribute to addressing patient needs. Moreover, increased use of such services may reduce the risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 by reducing social contact.",2022-04-07,J Med Internet Res,"Hajek, André; König, Hans-Helmut"
Treatment of psoriasis with biologics in the early COVID‐19 pandemic: A study examining patient attitudes toward the treatment and disease course,"BACKGROUND: Since March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has been ongoing all around the world with a wide range of clinical course including asymptomatic cases to severe and fatal respiratory tract disease. Patients on immunosuppressive treatments were predicted to be more susceptible to COVID‐19. AIMS: It was aimed to assess treatment continuity, the course of psoriasis and the course and clinical features of COVID‐19 in patients treated with biological agents for psoriasis at the early initial period of COVID‐19 pandemic. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients treated with biological agents for psoriasis at our institute were contacted by phone between 1 and 10 July 2020 and fulfilled a questionnaire about their continuity to psoriasis treatments, clinical course of psoriasis, and any suspicion/diagnosis of COVID‐19. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients, 41 females and 65 males, were enrolled. Mean age of the patients was 46.1 ± 12.1 years (range: 19–77). Median duration of psoriasis was 18 years (min–max: 1 month–51 years). Twenty‐four patients (22.6%) were using tumor necrosis alpha inhibitors (ETA:1, IFX:19, ADA:4), whereas 82 patients (77.4%) were using interleukin (IL) 12/23 or IL‐17 inhibitors (UST:48, SECU:30, IXE:4). Seventy‐six patients (71.7%) continued the treatment, whereas 30 patients (28.3%) interrupted the treatment voluntarily. Twenty out of 30 patients (66.6%) who interrupted the treatment had an exacerbation of psoriasis. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID‐19 in the study period. CONCLUSION: Patients with psoriasis who received biological therapy continued their treatment at a high rate during the early period of the COVID‐19 pandemic. No COVID‐19 diagnosis was made among patients whether they continued or discontinued treatment. Recurrence and exacerbation of psoriasis in a significant proportion of patients who interrupted treatment and absence of COVID‐19 diagnosis in each group support the importance and safety of continuity of biological treatments for psoriasis in COVID‐19 era.",2021-08-08,J Cosmet Dermatol,"Yalici‐Armagan, Basak; Tabak, Gulsun Hazan; Dogan‐Gunaydin, Sibel; Gulseren, Duygu; Akdogan, Neslihan; Atakan, Nilgun"
Socio-Economic analysis of disproportions and disbalances of the raw material export model in post-Soviet Russia,"The article provides a socio-economic analysis showing how the export-raw material model of economic growth adopted in post-Soviet Russia affects the socio-economic situation within the country in the context of an unprecedented global recession that is gaining momentum due to COVID-19 As a working hypothesis, the authors propose that the Russian Federation, where the extraction and export of mineral raw materials are the basis of its social and economic growth, has led to numerous production imbalances This not only lowers the quality and growth potential of Russia's future GDP but also undermines its macroeconomic stability and makes its national economy prone to oil shocks due to the dramatic global recession and lower demand for hydrocarbons The paper builds a linear regression model to assess the dependence of Russia's GDP on oil exports from 1996 to 2019 Besides, the authors obtained statistically significant regression equations confirming the theoretical assertion that the dependence of the rates of socio-economic growth on the export of natural raw materials reduces the quality and efficiency of state and public institutions since those in power are trying to legislatively facilitate their access to resources, which, in turn, significantly reduces the potential for economic growth The article confirms the need for a transition to a new (neo-industrial) socioeconomic paradigm since this will help overcome the production imbalance that has developed in the Russian economy, ensure long-term socio-economic growth, and increase its efficiency Proposals are formulated for the formation of economic conditions for neo-industrial economic development, the basis of which should be innovativeness, environmental friendliness, and inclusiveness © 2020 Lifescience Global",2020,International Journal of Criminology and Sociology,"Kormishkina, L.

Preventive Potential of the Aqueous Extract of the Mixture of Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae) and Cymbopogon citratus (Poaceae) Aerial Parts on Hypertension Induced by a Chronic Salt and Alcohol Consumption on the Rats,"High blood pressure (HBP) is currently one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Nowadays, populations make extensive use of alternative medicine for their health problems. Bidens pilosa (B. pilosa) and Cymbopogon citratus (C. citratus) are used individually in the traditional treatment of cardiovascular disorders. This study assessed the effects of the mixture of these two plants aqueous extract on HBP in rats. Male rats (42) were divided into 7 groups of 6 rats each. Normotensive rats received only distilled water and formed group 1. The other animals received ethanol + salt preceded by distilled water (10 mL/kg; group 2) and spironolactone (10 mg/kg; group 3); the aqueous extracts of the mixture (100 and 200 mg/kg; groups 4 and 5) isolated plants B. pilosa (200 mg/kg; group 6) and C. citratus (200 mg/kg; group 7). Animals were treated for 7 weeks during which water consumption and urine volume were assessed; then, hemodynamic parameters were recorded, and rats were sacrificed. Serum and some organs (liver, kidney, heart, and aorta) were used to evaluate biochemical parameters. Ingestion of ethanol + salt leads to a significant increase in urinary volume and water intake that were significantly prevented by the extracts from the mixture and isolated plants. Ethanol + salt solution significantly increased the blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-chol), atherogenic indices, liver and kidney function parameters, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), albumin, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly reduced. The extracts of the mixture and isolated plants significantly prevented all these variations with a more pronounced action for the lowest dose of the mixture on the lipid profile, oxidative stress, and kidney function. These observations confirm the beneficial effects of B. pilosa and C. citratus to manage hypertension.",2022-03-09,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,"Tcheutchoua, Yannick Carlos; Bilanda, Danielle Claude; Dzeufiet, Paul Désiré Djomeni; Djunie Neali, Oriane Corine; Owona, Pascal Emmanuel; Bidingha, Ronald à Goufani; Ngapout, Rodrigue Fifen; Mbolang, Lohik Nguegan; Noubom, Michel; Dimo, Théophile; Kamtchouing, Pierre"
The use of video to maximise cooking skills,"Purpose The aim of this research is to examine the impact of video-based learning on the cooking skills development of students. More specifically, exploring the first stages in the learning process through embedding declarative knowledge utilising both video content and learner profiles, with the purpose to make teaching practice more effectively and efficiently targeted. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative social experimental approach was employed. The sample consisted of 414 students from three post primary schools in Northern Ireland. Students were randomly allocated into both control and experimental video content groups. All participants were made aware of ethical procedures and the nature of the study. Findings Through the application of latent class analysis (LCA), three distinct types of students were classified. Class one (n = 250) students were termed independent learners, class two (n = 88) students were motivated and benefited from video-based learning and class three (n = 52) students demonstrated an inability to apply information because video did not assist in embedding declarative knowledge. Research limitations/implications Implications from this research inform content generation for video-based cooking skills. Practical implications Given the unprecedented move towards online teaching in 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions, there is increasing interest in targeting resources effectively to meet the requirements of all learning groups. This paper fulfils an identified need to study how video impacts on skills development and learning within specific learning typologies.

"Intimate Partner Violence, Human Rights Violations, and HIV among Women in Nairobi, Kenya","This study presents qualitative results from a mixed-method investigation conducted between May and August 2012 into the prevalence and consequences of four forms of intimate partner violence among women living with HIV who attended the Comprehensive Care Clinic at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi. As a part of the research, a quantitative survey found that among 600 sexually active women living with HIV aged 18–69, all reported experiencing emotional abuse; 20%, 17%, and 15% experienced controlling behavior, physical violence, and sexual violence, respectively. Qualitative research using focus group discussions with 19 women from the quantitative survey sought to contextualize these experiences and place them within a larger social structure where institutionalized gender inequality sets the tone for intimate partner violence against women in households. Participants reported that intimate partner violence led to their exposure to the virus and made them leery of disclosing their positive status or seeking support from a male partner for fear of a violent reaction. This fear and the socio-structural conditions in Kenya limit their ability to actively pursue comprehensive care, the stress of which can exacerbate symptoms and make managing the disease more difficult.",2020-12-03,Health Hum Rights,"Andrews, Courtney; Reuter, Tina Kempin; Marsh, Lauren; Velazquez, Judith M.; Jaoko, Walter; Jolly, Pauline"
"Adolescents’ sedentary time, affect, and contextual factors: An ecological momentary assessment study","BACKGROUND: Few adolescents achieve sufficient levels of physical activity, and many are spending most of their time in sedentary behavior. Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10–16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6 ± 1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4 ± 6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent’s positive affect in home settings.

LUCAS: A highly accurate yet simple risk calculator that predicts survival of COVID-19 patients using rapid routine tests,"There is an urgent need to develop a simplified risk tool that enables rapid triaging of SARS CoV-2 positive patients during hospital admission, which complements current practice. Many predictive tools developed to date are complex, rely on multiple blood results and past medical history, do not include chest X ray results and rely on Artificial Intelligence rather than simplified algorithms. Our aim was to develop a simplified risk-tool based on five parameters and CXR image data that predicts the 60-day survival of adult SARS CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission. Methods We analysed the NCCID database of patient blood variables and CXR images from 19 hospitals across the UK contributed clinical data on SARS CoV-2 positive patients using multivariable logistic regression. The initial dataset was non-randomly split between development and internal validation dataset with 1434 and 310 SARS CoV-2 positive patients, respectively. External validation of final model conducted on 741 Accident and Emergency admissions with suspected SARS CoV-2 infection from a separate NHS Trust which was not part of the initial NCCID data set. Findings The LUCAS mortality score included five strongest predictors (lymphocyte count, urea, CRP, age, sex), which are available at any point of care with rapid turnaround of results. Our simple multivariable logistic model showed high discrimination for fatal outcome with the AUC-ROC in development cohort 0.765 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738 - 0.790), in internal validation cohort 0.744 (CI: 0.673 - 0.808), and in external validation cohort 0.752 (CI: 0.713 - 0.787). The discriminatory power of LUCAS mortality score was increased slightly when including the CXR image data (for normal versus abnormal): internal validation AUC-ROC 0.770 (CI: 0.695 - 0.836) and external validation AUC-ROC 0.791 (CI: 0.746 - 0.833). The discriminatory power of LUCAS and LUCAS + CXR performed in the upper quartile of pre-existing risk stratification scores with the added advantage of using only 5 predictors. Interpretation This simplified prognostic tool derived from objective parameters can be used to obtain valid predictions of mortality in patients within 60 days SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR results. This free-to-use simplified tool can be used to assist the triage of patients into low, moderate, high or very high risk of fatality and is available at https://mdscore.net/.",2021-04-30,,"Ray, S.; Swift, A.; Fanstone, J.

High seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among high-density communities in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection had been investigated utilizing serology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This community-based sero-survey was carried out in the neighborhoods of three cities in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Of 5629 participants, 2766 (49.1%) were women; and 2148 (38.1%) were 18–34 years of age, and 3645 (64.7%) were from South East Asia. Positive serology was seen in 2825 (50.2% (95% CI: 48.8–51.5%) for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG antibodies by ECLIA. Being in the age category of 18–34 years and being from Eastern Mediterranean Region (country A) were associated with higher COVID-19 seropositivity with estimated odds ratio of 1.3 [95% CI 1.1–1.8] and 2.5 [95% CI 1.1.5–4.2] respectively. Gender, social status, education, nationality, symptoms, presence of comorbidities and activity style were positively associated with increased seropositivity.

A multi-class gene classifier for SARS-CoV-2 variants based on convolutional neural network,"Surveillance of circulating variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We propose an alignment-free in silico approach for classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their genomic sequences. A deep learning model was constructed utilizing a stacked 1-D convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pre-processed genomic sequencing data of the four SARS-CoV-2 variants were first fed to three stacked convolution-pooling nets to extract local linkage patterns in the sequences. Then a 2-layer MLP was used to compute the correlations between the input and output. Finally, a logistic regression model transformed the output and returned the probability values. Learning curves and stratified 10-fold cross-validation showed that the proposed classifier enables robust variant classification. External validation of the classifier showed an accuracy of 0.9962, precision of 0.9963, recall of 0.9963 and F1 score of 0.9962, outperforming other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. By comparing our model with an MLP model without the convolution-pooling network, we demonstrate the essential role of convolution in extracting viral variant features. Thus, our results indicate that the proposed convolution-based multi-class gene classifier is efficient for the variant classification of SARS-CoV-2.",2021-11-23,bioRxiv,"Fan, Junyu; Chen, Chutao; Song, Chen; Pan, Jiajie; Wu, Guifu"

"Respiratory support in COVID-19 patients in Kommunarka hospital: a single-centered, retrospective study","Introduction. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, worldwide healthcare system faced a new, insufficiently investigated, fast-spreading disease with multisystem failure and relatively high amount of severe diseased. Existing evidence base needs to be frequently revisited after data accumulation and analysis. Experience of dedicated COVID-19 centers should be summarized and implicated in clinical practice according to evidence-based principles, extensive clinical trial initiation. Objectives. To investigate baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection course, requiring respiratory support in the critical care settings of dedicated hospital. Materials and methods. In single-center retrospective study retrospective data collection of 451 respiratory support for COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome cases (noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation) in intensive care unit patients for a 5-month period performed. The analysis aimed on demographic, clinical data, disease severity scores, respiratory support parameters and modality, continuous renal replacement therapy utilization and interleukin-6 receptor blockers administration, survival rates. Results. Respiratory support required 48.8 % of intensive care unit patients, the population was demographically balanced, Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4.46 ± 2.6 and was higher in the mechanically ventilated group. 30-day survival rate (all respiratory support cases) was 33.7 %, mortality structure analysis performed. The disease severity scores, respiratory mechanics among patients in dependence of respiratory support mode and during the period of case registration analysed as well. Median static respiratory compliance at the point of initiation of invasive mechanically ventilation was 43 (IQR 35–51). Mortality in the volume controlled mechanically ventilated group was higher. Conclusions. The patients, requiring respiratory support, during intensive care unit stay have high comorbidity levels. Indications for non-invasive ventilation may be extended on patients with lower Charlson index and initial SOFA score, however, early recognition of high risk of noninvasive ventilation failure required. Volume control invasive ventilation associated with higher mortality levels despite comparable disease severity scores.

Global Judicial Opinions Regarding Government-Issued COVID-19 Mitigation Measures,"Laws play an important role in emergency response capacity. During the COVID-19 outbreak, experts have noted both a lack of law where it is needed and a problematic use of laws that exist. To address those challenges, policymakers revising public health emergency laws can examine how existing laws were used during the COVID-19 response to address problems that arose during their application. Judicial opinions can provide a source of data for this review. This study used legal epidemiology methods to perform an environmental scan of global judicial opinions, published from March 1 through August 31, 2020, from 23 countries, related to government-issued COVID-19 mitigation measures. The opinions were coded, and findings categorize the measures based on: (1) the World Health Organization's May 2020 publication, Overview of Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19, and (2) related legal challenges brought in courts, including disputes about authority; conflicts of law; rationality, proportionality, or necessity; implementation; and enforcement. The findings demonstrate how judicial review of emergency measures has played a role in the COVID-19 response. In some cases, court rulings required mitigation measures to be amended or stopped. In others, court rulings required the government to issue a measure not yet in place. These findings provide examples for understanding issues related to the application of law during an emergency response.",2022-04-01,Health Secur,"Clodfelter, Catherine G.; Caron, Sarah; Rosenfeld, Emily L.; Menon, Akshara Narayan; Sasser, Amanda; Mercier, Emmanuelle K.; Brush, C.

An update on coeliac disease from the NHS England National Centre for Refractory Coeliac Disease,"Coeliac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune-mediated gluten sensitive enteropathy, with a prevalence of around 1%. While the incidence of CD has increased over the last 2 decades, many cases still remain undiagnosed. The presentation of CD is variable and can be subtle, with it being important to explore both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal features. The cornerstone of management is adherence to a strict gluten free diet, which requires support and education from an expert gastrointestinal dietitian. Persisting symptoms in individuals requires re-evaluation, with repeat duodenal biopsies sometimes required. Refractory CD affects a small subset of individuals with CD, requiring specialist input.",2021,Clin Med (Lond),"Rej, Anupam; Sanders, David S"
Routine blood tests as an active surveillance to monitor COVID-19 prevalence. A retrospective study,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, one of the country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first autochthonous case appeared in Lombardy on February 20th, 2020. One month later, the number of COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed. RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found. Thus, the virus was likely circulating, within the Hospital catchment area, either in low amounts or through asymptomatic individuals. Because of the high LDH and AST levels’ variations induced by COVID-19, routine blood tests might be exploited as a surveillance indicator for a possible second wave.",2020-09-07,Acta Biomed,"Ferrari, Davide; Cabitza, Federico; Carobene, Anna; Locatelli, Massimo"

Effects of a School-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Obesity and Health-Related Physical Fitness in Adolescents With Intellectual Disability: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity accompanied by lower levels of health-related physical fitness (HRPF) is a major threat to public health both internationally and locally. Children with intellectual disability, especially adolescents, have a higher risk of being overweight/obese and having poor HRPF levels. Therefore, more interventions are needed to help this population attain their optimal health levels. However, there has been relatively limited research on this population compared with on their typically developing peers. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing and examining the success of a physical activity (PA) intervention for the target population. METHODS: The proposed study will be a 12-week, school-based randomized controlled trial. The participants (N=48) will be recruited from special schools for students with mild intellectual disability and then randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG) or the wait-list control group (CG). During the intervention period, the participants in the IG will receive a fun game–based moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) training program (2 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session, for a total of 24 sessions). The intensity of the activities will increase in a progressive manner. Participants in the CG will receive no program during the study period, but the same PA program will be provided to them after the completion of the study. To observe and evaluate the sustaining effects of the intervention, follow-up testing will be scheduled for the participants 12 weeks after the intervention concludes. The study outcomes will include primary outcomes (obesity- and fitness-related outcomes) and a secondary outcome (blood pressure). All of the measurements will be taken at 3 time points. After the follow-up tests, the same PA training program will be provided to the participants in the CG. RESULTS: This study is ongoing. The participants were recruited from October 2020 to November 2020. The total duration of the study is 13 months. Study results are expected at the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study is expected to reduce obesity and improve HRPF levels in children with intellectual disability. If proven effective, the intervention will be made accessible to more special schools and mainstream schools with students with intellectual disability. Furthermore, the study can serve as an example for international researchers, policy makers, and members of the public who are seeking to tackle the problem of obesity and poor HRPF among children with intellectual disability.

Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis,"Background Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11·1 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

"Stress, Anxiety, and Change in Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings Among Adult Twin Pairs","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of people worldwide since being declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in stress and anxiety, which may increase the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The objective of this study was to examine if stress and anxiety were associated with changes in alcohol use in a sample of adult twins. Twins allowed us to control for genetic and shared environmental factors that would confound the alcohol - mental health relationship. Twins (N = 3,971; 909 same-sex pairs) from the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) completed an online survey examining several health-related behaviors and outcomes and their self-reported changes due to COVID-19. About 14% of the respondents reported an increase in alcohol use. We found an association between both stress and anxiety and increased alcohol use, where twins with higher levels of stress and anxiety were more likely to report an increase in alcohol consumption. The associations were small and confounded by between-family factors and demographic characteristics. However, there was no significant difference in stress or anxiety levels between non-drinkers and those who reported no change in alcohol use. Our findings suggest that individuals’ mental health may be associated with changes in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-09-25,Front Psychiatry,"Avery, Ally R.; Tsang, Siny; Seto, Edmund Y.

Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across racial and ethnic groups. A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT, but more realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in an assortative mixing model fit to Long Island census data, 80% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in a disproportionate distribution of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021-01-15,,"Ma, K.

Transhepatic tract hemostasis using thermal-ablation after percutaneous portal vein access.,"Objectives Bleeding risk after percutaneous portal vein access procedures is not negligible. Various agents, coils and plug, have been used to minimize this risk, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This study reports the results of coagulation using thermal-ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) as an alternative to trans-hepatic puncture tract closure. Methods Ten patients who benefited from portal vein recanalization or portal hypertension-relative bleeding complication embolization using percutaneous portal vein access and who underwent thermal-ablation of the puncture tract between December 30, 2019 and July 16, 2020 were included. Early efficiency and safety were evaluated using imaging (ultrasound and/or CT scan) and laboratory data (hemoglobin, hepatic function) at 24 h. Follow-up was performed until August 2020. Results No bleeding from the puncture tract and no embolization-related complications were observed in all 10 patients at 24 h or during follow-up with median of 3 months (range 1-8 months), even in case of ascites or therapeutic coagulation. Conclusion Thermal-ablation seems to be a safe, effective and rapid technique to avoid bleeding after percutaneous transhepatic direct portal vein access. Advances in knowledge Thermal-ablation could be an alternative for transhepatic puncture tract closure especially for patients with high bleeding risk.",2022-01-01,BJR case reports,"Vermersch, Mathilde; Denys, Alban; Artru, Florent; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Villard, Nicolas; Duran, Rafael; Hocquelet, Arnaud"
Atypical endometriosis is related to a higher recurrence rate,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical characteristics and recurrence rate of atypical endometriosis (AE) compared to typical endometriosis (TE) in addition to the malignant transformation rate among a large cohort. STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of 2681 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of ovarian endometrioma between January 2008 and September 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into AE (n = 86) and TE (n = 2595) groups. Patients’ characteristics and recurrence rates were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean size of ovarian cysts was significantly larger in the AE group (7.6 ± 3.5 cm vs 6.7 ± 3.3 cm, p = 0.01) and the proportion of nulliparous women was significantly lower in AE group (65.1 % vs 77.8 %, p = 0.008). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. After Cox regression analyses with IPTW was adjusted, the risk factors for recurrent endometrioma were higher preoperative CA125 level >48 U/mL (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.741; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.517−4.952; p < 0.001), multilocular cyst (HR = 1.909; 95 % CI = 1.128−3.230; p = 0.016), and atypical endometriosis (HR = 2.666; 95 % CI = 1.659−4.284; p < 0.001). The AE group displayed a significantly higher cumulative recurrence rate than the TE group (p = 0.0057, log-rank test). No patients were diagnosed with atypical endometriosis to malignant transformation during the follow-up periods. However, two typical endometriosis patients experienced borderline malignancy and serous carcinoma, respectively. CONCLUSION: Recurrence rates for AE were higher than for TE. Although the AE group included no patient with malignant transformation in this study, considering the higher recurrence as well as the possibility of malignant transformation, long-term close surveillance is warranted.",2020-09-06,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"Won, Seyeon; Cho, Yeon Jean; Lee, Nara; Kim, Miseon; Kim, Mi Kyoung; Jung, Yong Wook; Yun, Bo Seong; Seong, Seok Ju; Hur, Junguk; Kim, Mi-La"

Adverse reactions to the first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers,"INTRODUCTION: In the current coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the messenger RNA vaccines have been shown to help protect high-risk groups from COVID-19. Among healthcare workers vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a survey was conducted to analyze the relationship between the incidence and severity of adverse reactions after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective self-reported survey of adverse reactions among healthcare workers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®) in Japan. After the first and second dose of vaccine, local and systemic reactions for 8 days after vaccination were reported by volunteer participants using a website. After receiving vaccination, 374 respondents participated in this matched-pair study. RESULTS: Both the incidence and severity of adverse reactions tended to be higher after the second vaccine dose than after the first dose. However, the incidence and numeric rating scale (NRS) score of muscle and skin pain were nearly the same after the first and second doses. In a comparison by sex, women had significantly higher incidence and NRS scores for adverse reactions such as headache, skin pain, erythema, and itching. The results also showed that younger age groups had higher incidence rates and NRS scores for all adverse reactions investigated, except for muscle pain, compared with older age groups. CONCLUSION: Some adverse reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty® COVID-19 vaccine showed gender and age differences. However, generally speaking, all side reactions disappear within a week. Therefore, these side reactions are not a significant concern in recommending vaccination.",2022-03-25,J Infect Chemother,"Maruyama, Ayano; Sawa, Teiji; Teramukai, Satoshi; Katoh, Norito"
Patient preferences for health information technologies: A systematic review,"Background: Advances in patient-facing health information technology (HIT) promise to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes. Low utilization of HIT suggests that the preferences of patients may not be adequately guiding the development of these technologies. This systematic review offers an assessment of published evidence regarding patient preferences for HIT. Methods: Articles addressing preferences for HIT from patient and other end-user groups published up through 2020 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and via hand searching. Articles that used quantitative stated-preference methods to explore preferences for HIT were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explored attitudes towards HIT without eliciting trade-offs were excluded. Critical appraisal of study quality was conducted using the PREFS checklist and quality criteria identified by the US Food and Drug Administration including heterogeneity analysis and patient engagement in study design. We conducted thematic analysis of the main preference findings from each study to synthesize patient and enduser preferences for HIT. The review was not registered and authors received no funding to conduct the review. Results: The search yielded 7,299 unique articles, 59 of which were ultimately included in the review. Studies explored preferences for telemedicine (n=30), patient portals (n=12), mHealth (n=9) or multiple HITs (n=8). Preference elicitation methods included direct elicitation (n=26), discrete-choice experiments (n=13), conjoint analysis (n=6), contingent valuation (n=5), and ranking exercises (n=9). Studies had a mean PREFS score of 3.51 out of 5. Forty-two studies conducted preference heterogeneity analysis and only 20 included patients in study design. Thematic meta-analysis indicated that patients prefer HIT that is convenient and lower cost, but does not sacrifice quality, and preferences varied by demographic features such as age as well as depending on the type of health information being communicated. Conclusions: Patient and end-users have distinct preferences for the use of HIT in their medical care. It is timely that researchers and healthcare administrators consider these preferences for HIT given its rapid uptake amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this literature demonstrates that patients can be engaged as participants in preference studies to identify meaningful aspects of HIT, the field was limited in its inclusion of patients in the design of such studies. Future development of HIT should be guided by high-quality preference research that integrates patients in all stages in the design and implementation of HIT. © Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

Temporal associations between insomnia and depression symptoms in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-lagged path modelling analysis,"It is well recognised that there is an intimate relationship between sleep and depression, with poor quality or short duration sleep associated with greater symptoms of depression. However, it is not clear from the current evidence base what the temporal relationship is between symptoms of insomnia and depression. Further, it is also unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on such relationships. In this study we have examined the longitudinal relationships between symptoms of depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic at two points separated by one year (April/May 2020 and March/April 2021) in a sample of 1032 Irish adults using a cross-lagged paths model. We report that there is a bidirectional relationship across time between depression and insomnia symptoms (β = -0.115 between Insomnia symptoms and subsequent depression symptoms and β = -0.163 between depression symptoms and subsequent insomnia symptoms; scales scored in opposite directions), and that these relationships persist when COVID-19 anxiety, age and sex are introduced into the model. Our analyses suggest that during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that insomnia symptoms predicted depression symptoms one year later, and conversely that depression symptoms predicted subsequent insomnia symptoms.",2022-03-30,Psychiatry Res,"Raman, Sudha; Hyland, Philip; Coogan, Andrew N."
Making sense of COVID-19: a longitudinal investigation of the initial stages of developing illness representations,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and explain peoples' developing threat appraisal and representations of the novel illness COVID-19 over the first months of the pandemic. The Common-Sense Model of illness perceptions provided the theoretical framework. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with 511 respondents and a follow-up study 4 months later on 422 respondents completing an online survey measuring demographic factors, media consumption, self-assessed health, experience with the disease, health anxiety, COVID-19 threat, worries and cognitive and emotional illness representations. RESULTS: Health anxiety, media consumption, female gender, lower self-assessed health, knowing a deceased COVID-19 patient and being infected explained variance in threat appraisal. Worries represented 2 factors: psychosocial and existential. Threat appraisal and worries explained variance in illness representations. Representations of the disease worsened and started stabilizing over time. Emotional representations were exceptionally stable and explainable by threat appraisals.

COVID-19 Ischemic Strokes as an Emerging Rehabilitation Population: A Case Series,"There is emerging literature that coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) infections result in an increased incidence of thrombosis secondary to a prothrombotic state. Initial studies reported ischemic strokes primarily occurring in the critically ill COVID-19 population. However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young non-critically ill COVID-19 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the COVID-19 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of COVID-19 ischemic strokes occurring in patients 37 to 68 years of age with varying COVID-19 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (e.g. focal and non-focal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of COVID-19 ischemic strokes. The duration of the COVID-19 related prothrombotic state is unknown and it is unclear if patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more COVID-19 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Due to the variable presentation of COVID-19 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in COVID-19 patients with either acute focal or non-focal neurologic symptoms. Additional studies are needed to clarify prothrombotic state duration, determine prognosis for recovery, and establish the physiatrist’s role in long term disease management.",2020-07-15,Am J Phys Med Rehabil,"Diaz-Segarra, Nicole; Edmond, Arline; Kunac, Anastasia; Yonclas, Peter"
Systemic Tissue and Cellular Disruption from SARS-CoV-2 Infection revealed in COVID-19 Autopsies and Spatial Omics Tissue Maps,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has infected over 115 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.",2021-03-09,bioRxiv,"Park, Jiwoon; Foox, Jonathan; Hether, Tyler; Danko, David; Warren, Sarah; Kim, Youngmi; Reeves, Jason; Butler, Daniel J.; Mozsary, Christopher; Rosiene, Joel; Shaiber, Alon; Afshinnekoo, Ebrahim; MacKay, Matthew; Bram, Yaron; Chandar, Vasuretha; Geiger, Heather; Craney, Arryn; Velu, Priya; Melnick, Ari M.; Hajirasouliha, Iman; Beheshti, Afshin; Taylor, Deanne; Saravia-Butler, Amanda; Singh, Urminder; Wurtele, Eve Syrkin; Schisler, Jonathan; Fennessey, Samantha; Corvelo, André; Zody, Michael C.; Germer, Soren; Salvatore, Steven; Levy, Shawn; Wu, Shixiu; Tatonetti, Nicholas; Shapira, Sagi; Salvatore, Mirella; Loda, Massimo; Westblade, Lars F.; Cushing, Melissa; Rennert, Hanna; Kriegel, Alison J.; Elemento, Olivier; Imielinski, Marcin; Borczuk, Alain C.; Meydan, Cem; Schwartz, Robert E.; Mason, Christopher E."
Consensus of the Study Group for Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in the intensive care management of COVID-19 patients.,"Respiratory failure is a dominating medical issue in the severe course of COVID-19. Both at the stage of diagnostics prior to admission to the intensive care unit and during the monitoring of lesion evolution, diagnostic imaging techniques may significantly influence clinical decisions. Although computed tomography remains the gold standard for diagnosing lung diseases, its usefulness for infected, critically ill patients has been largely limited during the pandemic. Reports from those countries in which the healthcare systems were most seriously overloaded with patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia stress the key role of point-of-care lung ultrasound performed by clinicians first during preliminary diagnostics and then while monitoring disease dynamics. This consensus, worked out by an interdisciplinary team of specialists forming the Study Group for Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in the Intensive Care Management of COVID-19 Patients, presents a broad spectrum of aspects regarding the analysed issue. Its concise form is meant to serve clinicians who perform ultrasound as a straightforward and informative guide.",2020,Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,"Buda, Natalia; Andruszkiewicz, Paweł; Czuczwar, Mirosław; Gola, Wojciech; Kosiak, Wojciech; Nowakowski, Piotr; Sporysz, Krystian"
Surveillance imaging of grade 1 astrocytomas in children: can duration and frequency of follow-up imaging and the use of contrast agents be reduced?,"PURPOSE: The optimum strategy for the surveillance of low-grade gliomas in children has not been established, and there is concern about the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), particularly in children, due to their deposition in the brain. The number of surveillance scans and the use of GBCAs in surveillance of low-risk tumours should ideally be limited. We aimed to investigate the consistency and utility of our surveillance imaging and also determine to what extent the use of GBCAs contributed to decisions to escalate treatment in children with grade 1 astrocytomas. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-centre study at a tertiary paediatric hospital. All children with a new diagnosis of a non-syndromic World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 astrocytoma between 2007 and 2013 were included, with surveillance imaging up to December 2018 included in analysis. The intervals of surveillance imaging were recorded, and imaging and electronic health records were examined for decisions related to treatment escalation. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients had 690 surveillance scans in the study period. Thirty-one patients had recurrence or progression leading to treatment escalation, 30 of whom were identified on surveillance imaging. The use of GBCAs did not appear to contribute to multidisciplinary team (MDT) decisions in the majority of cases. CONCLUSION: Surveillance imaging could be reduced in number and duration for completely resected cerebellar tumours. MDT decisions were rarely made on the basis of post-contrast imaging, and GBCA administration could therefore potentially be restricted in the setting of surveillance of grade 1 astrocytomas in children.",2020-11-25,Neuroradiology,"Campion, Tom; Quirk, Bernadine; Cooper, Jessica; Phipps, Kim; Toescu, Sebastian; Aquilina, Kristian; Green, Katherine; Hargrave, Darren; Mankad, Kshitij"

An Outreach Phone Call Project: Using Home Health to Reach Isolated Community Dwelling Adults During the COVID 19 Lockdown,"Home health care (HHC) focuses on delivering skilled health care services to patients in their homes. Over 82% of HHC patients are 65 and older, and living with chronic health conditions. In an effort to respond to the risk the COVID-19 pandemic presented for patients, a HHC agency designed “The Outreach Phone Call Project”. This program was developed to provide telephone support to at-risk patients who had received HHC prior to the COVID-19 lockdown. In total, 16 Care Transition Managers participated in the project and over 4,000 patients received a call from the clinical team. Approximately 44% of the calls did not require any further follow up, 20% of the patients did not answer the call, and 3% of patients were referred back to HHC. Another 13% needed education and assistance with social issues. The calls provided a means of safe connection and support between providers and patients during the pandemic and facilitated access to health and social resources. However, the most beneficial aspect of the program was the opportunity for seasoned HHC nurses to identify clinical changes in the health of patients and to assist them in the triage process. Results of this study demonstrate that the implementation of a calling project during the pandemic shutdown provided invaluable connection and outreach to vulnerable populations. This simple change in practice enabled HHC professionals to reach patients who were isolated and in need of education and assistance. As a result of the implementation of an “Outreach Phone Call Project”, the HHC agency learned many lessons which may be helpful to others who would like to create a similar program in the future. It facilitated clinical assessment, education and intervention for isolated patients during the COVID 19 pandemic and implementation of similar practice should be considered in the post-pandemic world.",2021-11-09,J Community Health,"Miner, Sarah; Masci, Lora; Chimenti, Chris; Rin, Nary; Mann, Adrianne; Noonan, Brigid"

Hypocalcemia prevention and management after thyroidectomy in children: A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION Hypocalcemia is the most common complication following thyroidectomy in children. Guidelines to manage post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia are available for adults, but not children. The objective of this review was to identify practices related to hypocalcemia prevention and management in pediatric patients. METHODS We identified studies examining the prevention and management of hypocalcemia in pediatric patients post-thyroidectomy within PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Three independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers. RESULTS A total of 15 studies were included, representing 1552 patients. The overall study quality was weak with lack of randomization and inconsistent outcome reporting. The pooled incidence of hypocalcemia from the 15 studies was 35.5% for transient hypocalcemia and 4.2% for permanent hypocalcemia. All studies discussed post-operative hypocalcemia treatment, with most patients requiring admission for intra-venous calcium therapy. One study described a protocol discharging asymptomatic patients on calcitriol and calcium. Three studies discussed preoperative calcium supplementation in patients at risk of hypocalcemia. No studies examined routine use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION A significant number of children undergoing thyroidectomy develop hypocalcemia. Despite this high incidence, our systematic review demonstrates significant practice variation surrounding post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia prevention and management in children.

Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased COVID-19 Severity: Prospective Screening of At-Risk Groups is Medically Indicated,"Non-classical actions of Vitamin D are involved in regulation of the immune system including a role in mitigation of excessive inflammation. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency existing prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to patients developing severe pulmonary compromise as a result of dysfunctional hyperinflammation. Serum vitamin D concentrations of patients experiencing such severe COVID-19 manifestations that they required ICU care at any point of their hospitalization were compared to serum vitamin D concentrations of patients achieving discharge without the need for any ICU care. Having serum vitamin D < 20 ng/mL was significantly associated with increased COVID-19 severity, p=0.001. It is conjectured that population groups know to have low serum vitamin D should be prospectively screened for deficiency and if found emergently treated. Such action could both decrease the maximum severity suffered by infected individuals and lessen the strain on medical resources by decreasing the percentage of COVID-19 hospital admissions requiring ICU care.",2020,,"Pepkowitz, Samuel Hobel Calvin Ms James Mirocha Kimia.Sobhani Bs Carissa Huynh Jawanda Harneet Hasan Wohaib"

Structural and Biophysical Characterization of the HCV E1E2 Heterodimer for Vaccine Development,"An effective vaccine for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major unmet medical and public health need, and it requires an antigen that elicits immune responses to multiple key conserved epitopes. Decades of research have generated a number of vaccine candidates; based on these data and research through clinical development, a vaccine antigen based on the E1E2 glycoprotein complex appears to be the best choice. One bottleneck in the development of an E1E2-based vaccine is that the antigen is challenging to produce in large quantities and at high levels of purity and antigenic/functional integrity. This review describes the production and characterization of E1E2-based vaccine antigens, both membrane-associated and a novel secreted form of E1E2, with a particular emphasis on the major challenges facing the field and how those challenges can be addressed.",2021-05-29,Viruses,"Toth, Eric A.; Chagas, Andrezza; Pierce, Brian G.; Fuerst, Thomas R."
The Effects of a Pandemic on Patient Engagement in a Patient-Reported Outcome Platform at Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Centers (106),"OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an important clinical tool to effectively collect, compile, and assess patient data and clinical progress. Beyond just tracking patient progress, PROs facilitate patient-provider communication and can be used to inform care practices. Though recent studies have focused on the merits of PRO collection in orthopaedics, few have sought to understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on PRO collection. Our objective is to review the initialization of an electronic PRO collection platform at our Orthopaedic Sports Medicine clinics and surgery center before and during the coronavirus pandemic. We focus specifically on our first 7,557 patients in a retrospective study and the interplay between our collection tactics and the patients’ responses to PROs from November 2019 to July 2020. METHODS: Starting in the fall of 2019, we implemented a new clinic-wide data capturing system to collect PROs and maintain our outcomes database. We began with a small group of providers and their patients before expanding to include most providers and staff in three clinics. Patients received the following forms prior to their first visit: Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference, PROMIS Physical Function, and subsequent corresponding anatomic-specific scales. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was later added in the spring of 2020. A secure link to the surveys was sent to the patient’s email or phone prior to their appointment or accessed via an iPad at the clinic’s kiosk during their appointment. However, due to coronavirus cleaning protocols, forms were only sent to the patient’s email or phone beginning in March. Upon completion of July 2020 collection, we utilized STATA statistical software to analyze the data and identify trends in patient responses. For statistical analysis, we used chi-squared tests. RESULTS: For the purpose of this study, we collected PROs from 7,557 patients between November 2019 and July 2020. After analyzing all data points in STATA, we determined differences in several collection categories, including the extent of completion and time of completion. Out of all patients prompted to complete one or more PROs, 37.20% of patients (n = 2811) did not complete any PROs, 11.86% of patients (n = 896) completed some but not all assigned PROs, and 50.95% of patients (n = 3850) completed all assigned PROs. Patients who completed all or some of their PROs completed them before their appointment 56.02% of the time (n = 2773), within an hour of their appointment 35.49% of the time (n = 1757), and after their appointment 8.48% of the time (n = 420) (see Figure 1). After separating PRO completion rates by month, we noticed a shift in compliance and patient response patterns before and during the coronavirus pandemic. From November to February, the average number of patients who completed one or more PROs was 80.20% (n = 1797) before dropping to an average of 57.74% (n = 5760; p <0.001) between March and July. The overall PRO compliance rate similarly dropped at our first PRO collection site, Clinic A, from an average of 86.75% to 76.81%, respectively (see Figure 2). Clinic operations were significantly reduced in late March due to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to majority telehealth visits and restrictions on clinic-wide shared iPad use. Though more than half of patients on average completed their PROs prior to their appointment throughout the year, this trend was especially prevalent during the coronavirus pandemic. For all or some PROs completed prior to appointment time, 42.34% were completed on average between November and February compared to 62.42% between March and July (see Figure 3). Beyond completion metrics, we observed a difference in appointment cancellations before and during the coronavirus pandemic. From November to February, 21.28% of patient appointments were canceled on average compared to 35.74% of appointments canceled on average from March to July. The number of cancelations during the coronavirus pandemic was significantly different than before the pandemic (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a short period of time (9 months) after initial implementation of a PRO platform, our practice has amassed significant data and reported outcomes for over 7,000 patients. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, patients were relatively receptive to the new PRO collection platform with over 80% of patients completing some or all assigned PROs. However, following our clinic-wide cessation of shared iPads due to coronavirus concerns, we noted a significant decrease in our patient compliance (80.20% down to 57.74%; p <0.001). Though discontinuation of iPad and kiosk use likely only contributed in part to this significant decrease, this observation still suggests that shared devices may play an important role in promoting PRO compliance within the clinic. It’s also important to note the limitations in this study, including the staggered integration of each provider’s patients. This likely impacted the increased compliance rates in November with 282 patients versus 1677 patients in July. In addition, compliance may have been affected by the transition from two research staff members helping collect PROs to one research staff member. Methods of promoting compliance also changed as we shifted to telehealth visits. In March and April, members of our research team called patients about their incomplete PROs, likely prompting increased responses prior to patient appointments. We are utilizing these observations to improve our workflow for collecting patient PROs and increase compliance within the clinic. After reflecting on our initial findings, we feel the use of devices in clinic and full staff involvement can bolster completion of PROs and are important tools in order to best maintain a data collection platform with high patient compliance.",2021-10-29,Orthop J Sports Med,"Barnds, Brandon; Witt, Atlee; Orahovats, Alexanda; Schlegel, Theodore; Hunt, Kenneth"

Initial distribution of COVID‐19 vaccines to front‐line hospital workers and community first responders—A prospective descriptive study,"As one of the initial ten sites in Ohio designated to receive and distribute the first COVID‐19 vaccines in December 2020, we initiated a self‐reported IRB‐approved research survey to describe the demographics, side‐effects, and missed work time experienced by front‐line health care workers in an urban tertiary care center and a rural regional hospital. First responders from both the urban and rural surrounding communities were also included in the initial Tier 1A vaccine distribution. The primary outcome measure was to identify the most frequently experienced side effects from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, based on type of vaccine, first or second dose, age, gender, race and occupation. The secondary outcome measure was to document the total number of work shifts missed after receiving the vaccine. Of interest to health care risk managers, the survey identified the most common side effects and resulting missed time from work broken down by type of vaccine and first or second dose. This information will be helpful for those institutions who have not yet vaccinated a majority of their work force, employees who still need their second dose, and for strategic scheduling of employees when booster doses become available later in the year.",2021-08-27,J Healthc Risk Manag,"Stausmire, Julie M.; Rohaley, Deidre J.; Tita, James A.; Buderer, Nancy M.; Nuesmeyer, Tamela; Faulkner, David L.; Sapara, Matthew"
Chinese Parental Awareness of Protective Measures for Children During COVID-19 Outbreaks,"Background: Currently children’s COVID-19 case numbers are gradually increased in various countries, and many parents fear for their children’ safety after schools reopen. The aim of this research was to investigate Chinese parents’ awareness of pediatric COVID-19 in relation to protecting their children. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Fujian and Jiangsu provinces in China using a web-based research questionnaire to investigate parents with children aged 6 to 16 years old. ResultsResearch samples included 1222 participants. 99.2% of participants were aware of respiratory transmission of COVID-19, and 75.6% also believed fecal-oral transmission to be possible. Although 98.3% of participants reported knowing how to properly wear and remove masks, most parents were unaware of good handwashing technique and answered incorrectly regarding cough etiquette. Research participants seemed uncertain of children’s symptoms. Awareness scores of participants significantly differed across parental role, educational attainment levels, and social-economic levels (P<0.005), with fathers, the better educated, and those of higher income showing higher levels of awareness. ConclusionResearch results suggest an urgent need for parental education regarding COVID-19 in children, especially regarding handwashing techniques and cough etiquette;educational facilities and outreach to parents and schoolchildren are particularly important.",2020,,"Peng, Niang-Huei Li ZhenZhen Meng Hongyan Chang Yue‐Cune Zhou JianFu"

A pilot study of natural orifice transanal endoscopic total mesorectal excision with laparoscopic assistance for rectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of natural orifice endoscopic transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) with laparoscopic assistance in a cohort study of five patients with stage I and IIA rectal cancer. METHODS Five eligible patients with node-negative rectal cancer located 4-12 cm from the anal verge were enrolled in an IRB-approved pilot study. All patients underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance, hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis, and a diverting loop ileostomy. Primary and secondary end points included adequacy of the mesorectal excision and 30-day postoperative complications, respectively. RESULTS Between November 2011 and May 2012, three males and two females underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance. Patient mean age and BMI were 48.6 ± 9.8 years and 25.7 ± 2.3 kg/m(2), respectively. Tumors were located an average of 5.7 ± 2.4 cm from the anal verge and preoperatively staged as T1N0M0 (2), T2N0M0 (1), and T3N0M0 (2). Mean operative time was 274.6 ± 85.4 min with no intraoperative complications. Partial intersphincteric resection was performed in conjunction with transanal endoscopic TME in three patients. Pathologic examination of TME specimens demonstrated complete mesorectal excision in all cases with negative proximal, distal, and radial margins. Mean length of hospital stay was 5.2 ± 2.6 days and three minor complications occurred, including one ileus and two cases of transient urinary dysfunction. At a mean early follow-up of 5.4 ± 2.3 months, all patients remain disease-free. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study of five patients with rectal cancer, transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance is feasible and safe, and is a promising alternative to open and laparoscopic TME. Evaluation of long-term functional and oncologic outcomes of this approach is needed before widespread adoption can be recommended.",2013,Surgical endoscopy,"Sylla, Patricia; Bordeianou, Liliana G; Berger, David; Han, Kyung S; Lauwers, Gregory Y; Sahani, Dushyant V; Sbeih, Mohammed A; Lacy, Antonio M; Rattner, David W"

Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (CyRPA) Elicits Detectable Levels of Invasion-Inhibitory Antibodies during Natural Infection in Humans.,"Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (CyRPA) is a conserved component of an essential erythrocyte invasion complex (RH5/Ripr/CyRPA) and a target of potent cross-strain parasite-neutralizing antibodies. While, naturally acquired human RH5 antibodies have been functionally characterized, there are no similar reports on CyRPA. Thus, we analyzed the parasite neutralizing activity of naturally acquired human CyRPA antibodies. In this regard, CyRPA human antibodies were measured and purified from malaria infected sera obtained from central India and analyzed for their parasite neutralizing activity in in vitro growth inhibition assays (GIA). We report that despite being susceptible to antibody, CyRPA being a highly conserved antigen does not appear to be under substantial immune selection pressure as a very low acquisition of anti-CyRPA antibodies was reported in malaria-exposed Indians. We demonstrate for the first time that the low amounts of natural CyRPA antibodies exhibited functional parasite-neutralizing activity and that a CyRPA based vaccine formulation induces highly potent antibodies in rabbits. Importantly, the vaccine induced CyRPA antibodies exhibited a robust IC50 of 21.96 μg/ml that is comparable to IC50 of antibodies against the leading blood stage vaccine candidate, RH5. Our data support CyRPA as a unique vaccine target that is highly susceptible to immune attack but highly conserved compared to other leading candidates such as MSP-1, AMA-1, further substantiating its promise as a leading blood-stage vaccine candidate.",2021-10-25,Infection and immunity,"Mian, Syed Yusuf; Somanathan, Anjali; Chaddha, Kritika; Pandey, Alok K; Singh, Hina; Krishna, Sri; Chaturvedi, Neha; Uchoi, Seemalata; Shukla, Man Mohan; Bharti, Praveen K; Singh, Neeru; Chauhan, Virander Singh; Gaur, Deepak"

Surveillance of COVID-19 Pandemic using Social Media: A Reddit Study in North Carolina,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has changed various aspects of people's lives and behaviors. At this stage, there are no other ways to control the natural progression of the disease than adopting mitigation strategies such as wearing masks, watching distance, and washing hands. Moreover, at this time of social distancing, social media plays a key role in connecting people and providing a platform for expressing their feelings. In this study, we tap into social media to surveil the uptake of mitigation and detection strategies, and capture issues and concerns about the pandemic. In particular, we explore the research question,""how much can be learned regarding the public uptake of mitigation strategies and concerns about COVID-19 pandemic by using natural language processing on Reddit posts?""After extracting COVID-related posts from the four largest subreddit communities of North Carolina over six months, we performed NLP-based preprocessing to clean the noisy data.

Nursing Students’ Informal Learning of Patient Safety Management Activities,"Nursing students require experience in patient safety management to prevent accidents that compromise patient safety. This study examined the mediating effects of informal learning on nursing students’ patient safety management activities. Responses to questionnaires issued to 136 nursing students in South Korea were analyzed. The independent, mediating, and dependent variables used were nursing competencies, informal learning, and patient safety management activities, respectively. Concept validity and model fitness were confirmed using average variance extracted and composite reliability. Model fitness was confirmed using the goodness-of-fit index, normed fit index, Tucker–Lewis index, comparative fit index, and standardized root mean squared residual. The mediating effect was analyzed using the maximum likelihood method, and statistical significance was assessed through bootstrapping. Informal learning mediated the relationship between nursing competence and patient safety management activities. To improve the implementation of patient safety management activities and increase patient safety competence, learning and teaching of specific patient safety-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes need to be improved. For this, informal learning opportunities (e.g., simulation education and clinical practice) must be increased in the nursing curriculum, and the patient safety education capacity should be increased to maintain continuity and connectivity in clinical practice.",2021-11-25,Healthcare (Basel),"Kim, Nam-Yi"

Tonsillar origin of deep neck infection as a negative prognostic factor for developing complications,"Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the odontogenic and tonsillar origins of deep neck infection (DNI) as a negative prognostic factor for developing complications. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 544 patients with tonsillar and odontogenic origins of DNI treated between 2006 and 2015 at 6 ENT Departments and Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Complications from DNI (descending mediastinitis, sepsis, thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, pneumonia, and pleuritis) were evaluated in both groups and compared. Associated comorbidities (cardiovascular involvement, hepatopathy, diabetes mellitus respiratory involvement, gastroduodenal involvement) were reviewed. Results: Five hundred and forty-four patients were analyzed; 350/544 males (64.3%) and 19/544 females (35.7%). There were 505/544 cases (92.8%) with an odontogenic origin and 39/544 cases (7.2%) with a tonsillar origin of DNI. Complications occurred more frequently in the group with tonsillar origin of DNI (P < 0.001). There was no difference in diabetes mellitus between the two groups. Conclusions: Currently, the tonsillar origin of DNI occurs much less frequently; nevertheless, it carries a much higher risk of developing complications than cases with an odontogenic origin. We recommend that these potentially high-risk patients with a tonsillar origin of deep neck infections should be more closely monitored.",2021,Otolaryngol Pol,"Matousek, Petr; Cábalová, Lenka; Formánková, Debora; Staníková, Lucia; Celakovský, Petr; Mejzlík, Jan; Chrobok, Viktor; Komínek, Pavel"
The pandemic characteristics of 2019-nCoV: case-control study for severity and geographic locations for 2019-nCoV epidemics worldwide,"Using available official data we found 248 epidemics curves caused worldwide by the 2019-nCoV in the period December 2019-March 31st 2020. The analysis of this material allowed two main observations: 1) it is possible to describe the main geographical pathway of the diffusion of the virus in different directions. This strongly suggests a unique point of origin of the pandemics in Wuhan, China, from where it spread in many different directions. 2) of the 74 epidemics which were characterized by at least 1000 cases, 65 (90%) were located in the geographic region of the world delimitated by 52-30 degrees latitude North. Viceversa 110 (60%) of the 176 epidemics with less than 1000 cases were located outside the cited geographical world region. These results suggest considerations on the pandemic characteristics of 2019-nCoV.",2020,Ital J Pediatr,"Ronchetti, Roberto; Bianco, Pietro Massimiliano"
Early and dynamic alterations of Th2/Th1 in previously immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis: a prospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: T helper (Th) cells regulate sepsis processes, including primary pathogen clear and secondary pathogen defence. The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p < 0.001) and D7 (p < 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICU-acquired infections and 28-day death.

Coronavirus Disease 2019's (COVID-19's) Silver Lining-Through the Eyes of Radiation Oncology Fellows,"Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has propelled health care workers to the front lines against the pandemic. In addition to anxiety related to infection risks, trainees have the additional burden of learning and career planning while providing care in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment. We conducted a survey to evaluate the practical and psychosocial impact on radiation oncology fellows during the first month of the pandemic. Methods and Materials: A 4-part survey was designed and distributed to the fellows in our program. The survey was designed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on scope of activity and well-being (""Impact on You"") and to identify key lessons learned and social factors (""About You"") using Likert scales and open-ended response options. The survey included items from the Oldenburg Burnout questionnaire. Results: A total of 17 participants (71%) responded to the survey. Although there was a significant reduction in the mean time spent on in-person clinics (13.5 h/wk [pre-COVID] vs 9.3 h/wk [3 weeks into the COVID emergency response]; P = .002), this was replaced by virtual consults and other COVID-related activities. The proportion of respondents demonstrating features of burnout in the domains of ""disengagement"" and ""exhaustion"" was 71% and 64%, respectively. However, there was also evidence of resilience, with 47% respondents ""feeling energized."" Top ""concerns"" and ""negative changes"" identified related to learning, infection risk and safety, patient care, coping, and concerns about their home country. Top ""positive changes"" highlighted include work culture, appreciation for leadership caring for the team, the insistence on evidence to guide change, and the implementation of virtual health care. Conclusions: Negative impact needs to be anticipated, acknowledged, and managed. We anticipate understanding the positives that have emerged under these extraordinary circumstances is the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic, giving us tools and the best leverage to plan for the future.",2020,,"Pilar, Avinash; Gravel, Samuel Bergeron; Croke, Jennifer; Soliman, Hany; Chung, Peter; Wong, Rebecca K S"
"Describing the trend of ammonia, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides: the role of livestock activities in Northern Italy during Covid-19 quarantine","Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and ammonia (NH(3)) are among the main contributors to the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM(2.5)), which represent a severe risk to human health. Even if important improvements have been achieved worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for NOx and SOx release; instead, the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for NH(3) emissions. Due to the emergency of coronavirus disease, in Italy schools and universities have been locked down from late February 2020, followed in March by almost all production and industrial activities as well as road transport, except for the agricultural ones. This study aims to analyze NH(3), PM(2.5) and NOx emissions in principal livestock provinces in the Lombardy region (Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, and Mantua) to evaluate if and how air emissions have changed during this quarantine period respect to 2016-2019. For each province, meteorological and air quality data were collected from the database of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment, considering both data stations located in the city and the countryside. In the 2020 selected period, PM(2.5) reduction was higher compared to the previous years, especially in February and March. Respect to February, PM(2.5) released in March in the city stations reduced by 19%-32% in 2016-2019 and by 21%-41% in 2020. Similarly, NOx data of 2020 were lower than in the 2016-2019 period (reduction in March respect to February of 22-42% for 2016-2019 and of 43-62% for 2020); in particular, this can be observed in city stations, because of the current reduction in anthropogenic emissions related to traffic and industrial activities. A different trend with no reductions was observed for NH(3) emissions, as agricultural activities have not stopped during the lockdown. Air quality is affected by many variables, for which making conclusions requires a holistic perspective. Therefore, all sectors must play a role to contribute to the reduction of harmful pollutants.",2020-08-17,Environ Res,"Lovarelli, Daniela; Conti, Cecilia; Finzi, Alberto; Bacenetti, Jacopo; Guarino, Marcella"

"Exploring the changes in travel behavior in a developing country amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from Metro Cebu, Philippines","This article investigates changes in travel behavior from selected urban cities in Metro Cebu, Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic a year after the first lockdown. Different categories of community quarantine and granular lockdowns have since been imposed to curb the spread of the virus. An online survey was distributed to analyze socio-demographic characteristics and reasons for traveling in relation to weekly trip frequency before and during pandemic. These are presented and analyzed through data visualization and multinomial logistic regression. Results show that the major reason for traveling before pandemic was work-related but has since shifted to buying essentials or for leisure or recreation. Weekly trip frequencies were lesser when compared before pandemic, but several socio-demographic groups have shown otherwise. There is statistical significance for those less likely to travel when commuters are employed, self-employed or students compared to unemployed, earning PHP 10,000 or less compared to those earning above PHP 50,000, in a household size of 10 compared to all other household sizes, and those with college degree against elementary or no formal education. By determining the travel behavior of commuters when they have ample time to adjust to the new normal, their mobility needs can be best understood and consequently satisfied. Interventions in fulfilling the travel needs for those belonging to socio-demographic groups that are highly affected by the pandemic, such as the working class, blue-collar workers, and have limited financial capabilities, can also be developed when a similar outbreak in the future is imminent.",2021-09-14,Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,"Mayo, Francis L.; Maglasang, Renan S.; Moridpour, Sara; Taboada, Evelyn B."

Classification of viral zoonosis through receptor pattern analysis,"BACKGROUND: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.",2011-04-13,BMC Bioinformatics,"Bae, Se-Eun; Son, Hyeon Seok"

Drug-Induced vs. Viral Maculopapular Exanthem—Resolving the Dilemma,"Maculopapular exanthem is a commonly encountered presentation in routine clinical practice, and differentiation between its two most common etiologies, i.e., viral- and drug-induced, often poses a diagnostic dilemma. Clinical, hematological and biochemical investigations are seldom reliable in distinguishing between a drug reaction and a viral exanthem. Certain key histopathological features such as the presence of a moderate degree of spongiosis, extensive basal cell damage with multiple necrotic keratinocytes and dermal infiltrate rich in eosinophils or lymphocytes and histiocytes may favor a drug exanthem, while distinctive epidermal cytopathic changes and lymphocytic vasculitis point towards a viral etiology. Similarly, notable immunohistochemical markers such as IL-5, eotaxin and FAS ligand may support a diagnosis of a drug-induced maculopapular eruption. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations may help in distinguishing between the two etiologies when faced with a clinical overlap, especially in patients on multiple essential drugs when drug withdrawal and rechallenge is not feasible.",2022-05-07,Dermatopathology (Basel),"Khandpur, Sujay; Ahuja, Rhea"
COVID-19 in India: Statewise Analysis and Prediction,"BACKGROUND: The highly infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and subsequently spread to 212 countries and territories around the world, infecting millions of people. In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R2 values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.",2020,JMIR Public Health Surveill,"Ghosh, Palash; Ghosh, Rik; Chakraborty, Bibhas"
COVID-19 crisis and role of the Indian state,"COVID-19 has affected the world with varied intensity and India is no exception. The lockdown measures implemented in India to combat COVID-19 rendered significant economic costs in terms of loss of employment, income, and output. In this paper, we find that the national lockdown measures adopted by the GOI have weakened the states financially, making them financially more dependent on the centre. This paper argues that the interests of domestic capitalists and international finance capital have restricted India from increasing its government expenditure and adopting economic policies for the best benefits of its citizens. Thus, financial weakness of the state governments has accentuated during the lockdown period and has tilted the balance further in favour of the centre. This is neither encouraging from the perspective of fiscal federalism in India nor for the delivery of welfare to its citizens. This may even delay the process of India’s economic recovery.

"Shelter in Place, Connect Online: Trending TikTok Content During the Early Days of the U.S. COVID-19 Pandemic.","PURPOSE In the U.S., TikTok surged in popularity as the COVID-19 virus spread nationally. TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period. METHODS Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period. CONCLUSIONS On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.",2021-04-03,The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,"Unni, Zoya; Weinstein, Emily"
Comparative genomic analysis of the swine pathogen Bordetella bronchisepticastrain KM22,"The well-characterized Bordetella bronchiseptica strain KM22, originally isolated from a pig with atrophic rhinitis, has been used to develop a reproducible swine respiratory disease model. The goal of this study was to identify genetic features unique to KM22 by comparing the genome sequence of KM22 to the laboratory reference strain RB50. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, selected genes of KM22 were then compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from different hosts. Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.",2016-01-15,Vet Microbiol,"Nicholson, Tracy L.; Shore, Sarah M.; Register, Karen B.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Kingsley, Robert A.; Brunelle, Brian W."
The roles of implicit approach motivation and explicit reward in excessive and problematic use of social networking sites,"Despite growing concerns about the addictive potential of social networking sites (SNSs), little is known about the precise neural, cognitive, and emotional processes underpinning compulsive SNS behaviours, such as excessive checking of SNSs. Recent evidence points to the important role of reward in SNS behaviours and one avenue to examine reward processes related to SNSs is the use of behavioural paradigms that allow for the measurement of implicit motivational responses, such as the approach avoidance task (AAT). The AAT has been successfully utilised to capture changes in unconscious reward processes in substance use disorders and other behavioural addictions, with faster approach reactions to addiction-related stimuli reflecting increased wanting/urges to have/consume the reward. In the present study 411 young adults completed an online Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (VAAST) with social media and control logos as well as other subjective (explicit) measures of reward experience related to SNSs. Our results showed that across participants SNS logos elicited strong approach reactions (compared to control stimuli) and that stronger SNS approach tendencies predicted more frequent SNS checking. Importantly, increased approach motivation was not associated with more problematic use. However, both checking frequency and problematic use were related to alterations of explicit reward processing, including the subjective experience of SNS urges or wanting. We conclude that changes in automatic approach motivation towards SNS stimuli are common in most SNS users, which suggests that implicit imbuement of social media with reward has become pervasive among young adults. Problematic SNS use however may be more reliably indicated by changes in explicit reward processing, such as subjective wanting.",2022-03-16,PLoS One,"Wadsley, Michael; Ihssen, Niklas"

Smart equipment to protect patients and people from COVID disease,"An intelligent system is designed in this proposal to handle this crucial situation in a better way. The algorithm is developed in such a way that medical equipment are disposed of in hospitals as normal. If the hospital has a COVID-19 block the used equipment should be disposed of in a closed lid so that the spread of viruses can be reduced. The main motive of this proposal is to reduce the human resources, improve waste disposal, and make the waste reusable. In a hospital environment there is different color code that decides which equipment should be disposed of. The doctors and the nurse are the people who decide what color code is to be used for the disposal of medical equipment. The different color-coded waste bin is chosen for making reusable waste into a fertilizer for agricultural fields. To do this process the system is designed in an efficient method and cost reduction is maintained until the end of the process. Before entering the recycling process all the waste should be sanitized. After the verification process is done on the waste materials the recycling process gets started on the basis of the color code of the waste collection. A smart bin will be designed for each color code based on the usage of the medical equipment; the segregation process will be carried out in each phase. In the final phase after the recycling process it will be used as fertilizer and will be distributed to the farmers to improve crop yield. An algorithm is going to work on data verification and checking process, which will be done automatically. After the data automation process a intimation will be sent to the final testing process where it helps us to do segregation process in an efficient way.",2021-06-11,Biomedical Engineering Tools for Management for Patients with COVID-19,"Kumar, R.

"Live cell imaging by 3-imino-(2-phenol)-1,8-naphthalimides: The effect of ex vivo hydrolysis.","A series of 3-amino-N-substituted-1,8-naphthalimides and their salicylic Schiff base derivatives were synthesized. The structure of the obtained compounds was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis and COSY and HMQC for the representative molecules. The photophysical (UV-Vis, PL) and biological properties of all of the prepared compounds were studied. It was found that the amine with the n-hexyl group in EtOH had the highest PL quantum yield (Ф = 85%) compared to the others. Moreover, the chelating properties of the azomethines with the n-hexyl group (1a, 1b, 1c) were tested against various cations (Al3+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+ and Zn2+) in an acetonitrile, acetone and PBS/AC mixture. Compounds that contained the electron withdrawing groups (-Br, -I) had the ability to chelate most of the studied cations, while the unsubstituted derivative chelated only the trivalent cations such as Al3+, Cr3+ and Fe3+ in acetonitrile. The effect of the environment on the keto-enol tautomeric equilibrium was also demonstrated, especially in the case of the derivative with a bromine atom. The biological studies showed that the tested molecules had no cytotoxicity. Additionally, the ability to image intracellular organelles such as the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum was revealed.

COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE): A Tool and a Web Portal to Extract Drug - Target Protein Associations from the CORD-19 Corpus of Scientific Publications on COVID-19,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a widespread effort to identify drug candidates and biological targets of relevance to SARS-COV-2 infection, which resulted in large numbers of publications on this subject. We have built the COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, and annotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature on COVID-19 to assist drug repurposing efforts. Materials and Methods: SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed to identify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved through lookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used to identify co-occurrences of protein and drug terms, and confidence scores were calculated for each entity pair. Results: COKE processing of the current CORD-19 database identified about 3,000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 unique proteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of these drugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Discussion: The rapidly evolving situation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic growth of publications on this subject in a short period. These circumstances call for methods that can condense the literature into the key concepts and relationships necessary for insights into SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing. Conclusion: The COKE repository and web application deliver key drug - target protein relationships to researchers studying SARS-CoV-2.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and replicates within the cells of the nasal cavity, then spreads along the airway tracts, causing mild clinical manifestations, and, in a majority of patients, a persisting loss of smell. In some individuals, SARS-CoV-2 reaches and infects several organs, including the lung, leading to severe pulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological symptoms, likely contributing to morbidity and mortality through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic properties and functions in many tissues, including the nervous system. S1P regulates neurogenesis and inflammation and it is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of S1P receptors, has been approved for the treatment of MS and is being tested for COVID-19. Here, we discuss the putative role of S1P on viral infection and in the modulation of inflammation and survival in the stem cell niche of the olfactory epithelium. This could help to design therapeutic strategies based on S1P-mediated signaling to limit or overcome the host–virus interaction, virus propagation and the pathogenesis and complications involving the nervous system.",2020-09-15,Int J Mol Sci,"Meacci, Elisabetta; Garcia-Gil, Mercedes; Pierucci, Federica"
Nursing education on palliative care across Europe: Results and recommendations from the EAPC Taskforce on preparation for practice in palliative care nursing across the EU based on an online-survey and country reports.,"BACKGROUND Nurses are the largest regulated group of healthcare professionals involved in palliative care. In 2004, a taskforce of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) launched the 'Guide for development of palliative nurse education in Europe' (hereinafter, the EAPC 2004 Guide). No systematic evaluation of its impact in the development of palliative care education was undertaken. AIMS To describe current undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education across Europe; to identify the roles that nurses with different palliative care educational levels have in palliative care; and to assess the uptake of the EAPC 2004 Guide in the development of palliative care nursing in Europe. DESIGN Descriptive research involving an online survey among nursing experts, and the consultation of national representatives. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS A total of 135 nurses (52% response rate) from 25 countries completed the online survey; representatives from 16 countries were consulted. RESULTS In 14 (56%) countries, palliative care was not identified as a mandatory subject within undergraduate nursing education. The EAPC 2004 Guide is widely known and was/is being used in many countries to promote palliative care nursing education. Large variations were found across and within country responses. CONCLUSIONS Palliative care nursing education varies largely in Europe. The wide awareness and use of the EAPC 2004 Guide show how policy measures can influence the development of palliative care education. Recommendations are built and focus on both fostering the use of this guide and implementing policy measures to ensure that palliative care nursing is recognised and certified as a specialty in all European countries.",2020-09-11,Palliative medicine,"Martins Pereira, Sandra; Hernández-Marrero, Pablo; Pasman, H Roeline; Capelas, Manuel Luís; Larkin, Philip; Francke, Anneke L"
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on final year medical students in the United Kingdom: a national survey,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in unprecedented public health measures. This has impacted the UK education sector with many universities halting campus-based teaching and examinations. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year medical students' examinations and placements in the United Kingdom (UK) and how it might impact their confidence and preparedness going into their first year of foundation training. METHODS: A 10-item online survey was distributed to final year medical students across 33 UK medical schools. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice and likert response scale questions. Participants were asked about the effect that the COVID-19 global pandemic had on final year medical written exams, electives, assistantships and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The survey also explored the student's confidence and preparedness going into their first year of training under these new unprecedented circumstances. RESULTS: Four hundred forty students from 32 UK medical schools responded. 38.4% (n = 169) of respondents had their final OSCEs cancelled while 43.0% (n = 189) had already completed their final OSCEs before restrictions. 43.0% (n = 189) of assistantship placements were postponed while 77.3% (n = 340) had electives cancelled. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations and student assistantships significantly affected students' preparedness (respectively p = 0.025, 0.008, 0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p = 0.0005). The majority of students feel that measures taken during this pandemic to amend their curricula was necessary. Respondents also agree that assisting in hospitals during the outbreak would be a valuable learning opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: The impact on medical student education has been significant, particularly affecting the transition from student to doctor. This study showed the disruptions to student assistantships had the biggest effect on students' confidence and preparedness. For those willing to assist in hospitals to join the front-line workforce, it is crucial to maintain their wellbeing with safeguards such as proper inductions, support and supervision.",2020,BMC Med Educ,"Choi, Byung; Jegatheeswaran, Lavandan; Minocha, Amal; Alhilani, Michel; Nakhoul, Maria; Mutengesa, Ernest"
COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning,"The recent global outbreak of the coronavirus has thrown new challenges for the research community. First case was registered in China, and then, it got spread in most of the countries of the world. Initially, the speed of spread was slow but later on, its spread rate was very really high and on analysis it turned out to be exponential. Governments all across the world imposed lockdowns, and people were asked to practice social distancing in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Later on, it was announced as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Machine learning-driven methods can prove to be really vital in predicting risks, effects and parameters of this pandemic. These predictions will help in making strategies to control its spread and understand its nature. More research is beginning to anticipate and a remarkable amount of machine learning models are being talked about to predict COVID-19 cases used by experts or researchers around the globe. In this research project, we have used univariate LSTM model to make predictions. The number of confirmed cases, number of recovered cases and the number of death cases in the coming days are being predicted. Mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the measure of performance metric of the predicted results. The results produced are quite accurate. These results prove that univariate LSTM is a promising model to make predictions for COVID-19 outbreak. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2022,"5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, ICTIS 2021","Singh, J.; Yadav, S.; Chauhan, K.; Malhotra, R."
2. Labour and birth,"This chapter describes the national guidance for care during labour and childbirth in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. The content largely draws attention on the guidance developed by the Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), and specific guidance on infection prevention and control measures from Public Health England. The key areas addressed are as follows: The chapter refers to some of the ways in which the guidance was translated in practice. The guidance was developed using a rapid analysis approach to emerging research and evidence, along with evidence from previous experiences of coronavirus combined with consensus expert opinion from all key professionals providing maternity care in the UK. WHAT IS KNOWN: The UK RCOG/RCM COVID-19 guidance was widely accepted across the UK maternity services and also worldwide as a reliable and credible source of information to shape care during the pandemic. WHAT IS NOT KNOWN: The full impact of the pandemic on the experiences and outcomes for babies and women of pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenting in the UK. The impact of the new approaches to intrapartum care on experiences and outcomes for women, babies, and families. The impact of the changes required to intrapartum care as a result of the pandemic on the professional care provided; in terms of pressure created by rapidly changing approaches to care and restrictions on the ability to provide normal levels of care.",2021,Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,"Ross-Davie, Mary; Brodrick, Alison; Randall, Wendy; Kerrigan, Angela; McSherry, Maureen"
Preferential production of IgM-secreting hybridomas by immunization with DNA vaccines coding for Ebola virus glycoprotein: use of protein boosting for IgG-secreting hybridoma production,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate the utility of DNA vaccines encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) as a vaccine type for the production of GP-specific hybridomas and antibodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. Mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), limiting dilution subcloning, antibody purification methods, and Western blot assays were used to select GP-specific hybridomas and purify monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the hybridoma cells. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity, were selected by ELISA. When purified MAbs from 12 hybridomas were tested for their reactivity to GP, 11 MAbs, except for 1 MAb (from the A6-9 hybridoma) displaying an IgG2a type, were identified as IgM isotypes. Those 11 MAbs failed to recognize GP. However, the MAb from A6-9 recognized the mucin-like region of GP and remained reactive to the antigen at the lowest tested concentration (1.95 ng/mL). This result suggests that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by DNA vaccination. However, boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas than GP DNA vaccination alone. CONCLUSION: DNA vaccination may preferentially generate IgM-secreting hybridomas, but boosting with the protein antigen can reverse this propensity. Thus, this protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the context of the DNA vaccination platform. In addition, the purified monoclonal IgG antibodies may be useful as therapeutic antibodies for controlling Ebola virus infection.",2017-07-26,Clin Exp Vaccine Res,"Lee, Si-Hyeong; Han, Baek-Sang; Choe, Jongseon; Sin, Jeong-Im"
Structural determinants of health workforce burnout.,"COVID-19 has exposed the grim underbelly of a fragmented, regionalized, costly, and inefficient approach to health service that is an engine for health workforce burnout. A matrix framework that defines the nature of system-level structural determinants of burnout and their relationship to service-level wellness can serve as a useful tool to understand workforce burnout causality, and guide meaningful intervention. This could inform a constructive system-level approach to health workforce burnout through the establishment of harmonized principle-based interventions across health sector jurisdictions and stakeholders.",2022-05-22,Healthcare management forum,"Affleck, Ewan; Wagner, Jacqueline Emily"

Hierarchical Cell Death Program Disrupts the Intracellular Niche Required for Burkholderia thailandensis Pathogenesis,"Burkholderia infections can result in serious diseases with high mortality, such as melioidosis, and they are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Innate immunity is critical for cell-autonomous clearance of intracellular pathogens like Burkholderia by regulating programmed cell death. Inflammasome-dependent inflammatory cytokine release and cell death contribute to host protection against Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis; however, the contribution of apoptosis and necroptosis to protection is not known. Here, we found that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) lacking key components of pyroptosis died via apoptosis during infection. BMDMs lacking molecules required for pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis), however, were significantly resistant to B. thailandensis-induced cell death until later stages of infection. Consequently, PANoptosis-deficient BMDMs failed to limit B. thailandensis-induced cell-cell fusion, which permits increased intercellular spread and replication compared to wild-type or pyroptosis-deficient BMDMs. Respiratory B. thailandensis infection resulted in higher mortality in PANoptosis-deficient mice than in pyroptosis-deficient mice, indicating that, in the absence of pyroptosis, apoptosis is essential for efficient control of infection in vivo. Together, these findings suggest both pyroptosis and apoptosis are necessary for host-mediated control of Burkholderia infection.",2021-06-22,,"Place, David E.; Christgen, Shelbi; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Vogel, Peter; Malireddi, R.

"CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in 62 Patients in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 52.8 ± 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 ± 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 ± 3.8) and lower (4.5 ± 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 ± 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 ± 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (&#8804; 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.",2020,AJR Am J Roentgenol,"Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming"

This community‐engaged study aimed to examine strategies for disseminating online parenting resources in schools. Online resources were disseminated to parents in a Northern California school district. Dissemination strategies were informed by conversations with school principals, teachers, and parents and considered agent, message, and format. A total of 685 parents and teachers clicked on the online resources: 151 parents and 114 teachers attended synchronous classes. The use of dissemination strategies had a compounding influence on the number of synchronous class attendees and clicks. Emails sent by the school district yielded the greatest number of clicks, which was influenced by message content and format.

Doctors of chiropractic working with or within integrated healthcare delivery systems: a scoping review protocol.,"INTRODUCTION Back and neck pain are the leading causes of disability worldwide. Doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are trained to manage these common conditions and can provide non-pharmacological treatment aligned with international clinical practice guidelines. Although DCs practice in over 90 countries, chiropractic care is rarely available within integrated healthcare delivery systems. A lack of DCs in private practice, particularly in low-income communities, may also limit access to chiropractic care. Improving collaboration between medical providers and community-based DCs, or embedding DCs in medical settings such as hospitals or community health centres, will improve access to evidence-based care for musculoskeletal conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSES This scoping review will map studies of DCs working with or within integrated healthcare delivery systems. We will use the recommended six-step approach for scoping reviews. We will search three electronic data bases including Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Two investigators will independently review all titles and abstracts to identify relevant records, screen the full-text articles of potentially admissible records, and systematically extract data from selected articles. We will include studies published in English from 1998 to 2020 describing medical settings that have established formal relationships with community-based DCs (eg, shared medical record) or where DCs practice in medical settings. Data extraction and reporting will be guided by the Proctor Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, which has three domains: clinical intervention, implementation strategies and outcome measurement. Stakeholders from diverse clinical fields will offer feedback on the implications of our findings via a web-based survey. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published and publicly accessible data, but will be obtained for the web-based survey. Our results will be disseminated through conference presentations and a peer-reviewed publication. Our findings will inform implementation strategies that support the adoption of chiropractic care within integrated healthcare delivery systems.",2021-01-25,BMJ open,"Roseen, Eric J; Kasali, Bolanle Aishat; Corcoran, Kelsey; Masselli, Kelsey; Laird, Lance; Saper, Robert B; Alford, Daniel P; Cohen, Ezra; Lisi, Anthony; Atlas, Steven J; Bean, Jonathan F; Evans, Roni; Bussières, André"
Adverse events and breakthrough infections associated with COVID‐19 vaccination in the Indian population,"Vaccines against COVID‐19 provide immunity to deter severe morbidities associated with the infection. However, it does not prevent infection altogether in all exposed individuals. Furthermore, emerging variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 impose a threat concerning the competency of the vaccines in combating the infection. This study aims to determine the variability in adverse events and the extent of breakthrough infections in the Indian population. A retrospective study was conducted using a pre‐validated questionnaire encompassing social, demographic, general health, the status of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, vaccination, associated adverse events, and breakthrough infections in the Indian population. Informed consent and ethical approval were obtained as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Participants, who provided the complete information, were Indian citizens, above 18 years, and if vaccinated, administered with either Covishield or Covaxin, were considered for the study. Data have been compiled in Microsoft Excel and analyzed for statistical differences using STATA 11. The responses from 2051 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Among 2051, 1119 respondents were vaccinated and 932 respondents were non‐vaccinated. Among 1119 vaccinated respondents, 7 were excluded because of missing data. Therefore, out of 1112 vaccinated, 413 experienced adverse events with a major fraction of younger individuals, age 18–40 years, getting affected (74.82%; 309/413). Furthermore, considerably more females than males encountered adverse consequences to vaccination (p < 0.05). Among vaccinated participants, breakthrough infections were observed in 7.91% (88/1112; 57.96% males and 42.04% females) with the older age group, 61 years and above (odds ratio, 3.25 [1.32–8.03]; p = 0.011), and males were found to be at higher risk.

Temporal Variability and Social Heterogeneity in Disease Transmission: The Case of SARS in Hong Kong,"The extent to which self-adopted or intervention-related changes in behaviors affect the course of epidemics remains a key issue for outbreak control. This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (±0.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. We provide a general method to estimate time dependence of parameters in structured epidemic models, which enables investigation of the impact of control measures and behavioral changes in different settings.",2009-08-21,PLoS Comput Biol,"Cori, Anne; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Thomas, Guy; Leung, Gabriel M.; Valleron, Alain-Jacques"

Thinking outside the box: students positive about visionary elective curricula in medical school,"Objective: Space for personality development as well as for the development of critical, creative and interdisciplinary thinking is rarely found in medical curricula in Germany. To be prepared for the challenges of modern medicine, future physicians need a visionary mindset. The aim of this study is to determine the need for teaching such content among medical students in the context of visionary elective curricula and to examine these with regard to the desired topics and organizational structure. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with 236 medical students from all semesters of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. The survey consists of 50 questions and includes single choice, multiple choice, matrix questions, open-ended questions and Likert scales. Responses were examined using descriptive statistics and compared parametrically in sub-aspects. Results: Three-quarters of respondents would like to see curricular content on interdisciplinary interfaces with other disciplines. A suitable framework for this is seen by 87% of the respondents in a visionary elective curriculum. Students would like to see a broad range of specific content such as global health, politics, business, and computer science. The majority of respondents would like to see 1 unit of instruction per week and would participate in an appropriate program. Such an offering would promote creative (53.6%), critical (63.7%), and interdisciplinary thinking (69.0%) and train to become better physicians (87%). Conclusion: Participants in this study are positive toward the introduction of visionary content in medical school.

We aimed to inform how individual and institutional factors contributed for the preparedness to respond during the first months of a public health emergency. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We surveyed healthcare workers from a Local Health Unit in Portugal, which comprises primary health care centers and hospital services, including public health units and intensive care units, in the second and third months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. The 460 answers, completed by 252 participants (about 10% of the healthcare workers), were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions. We estimated adjusted odds ratios for the readiness and willingness to respond. RESULTS: Readiness to respond was associated with the perception of adequate infrastructures (aOR = 4.04, P < 0.005), lack of access to personal protective equipment (aOR = 0.26, P < 0.05) and organization (aOR = 0.31, P < 0.05). The willingness to act was associated with the perception of not being able to make a difference (aOR = 0.05, P < 0.005), risk of work-related burnout (aOR = 21.21, P < 0.01) and experiencing colleagues or patients’ deaths due to COVID-19 (aOR = 0.24, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate organization, infrastructures, and access to personal protective equipment may be crucial for workers' preparedness in a new public health emergency, as well workers’ understanding of their roles and expected impact. These factors, together with the risk of work-related burnout, shall be taken into account in the planning of the response of healthcare institutions in future public health emergencies.",2022-01-10,Public Health,"Leão, T.; Duarte, G.; Gonçalves, G."

Maternal sevoflurane exposure induces temporary defects in interkinetic nuclear migration of radial glial progenitors in the fetal cerebral cortex through the Notch signalling pathway,"OBJECTIVES: The effects of general anaesthetics on fetal brain development remain elusive. Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate the majority of neurons in developing brains. Here, we evaluated the acute alterations in RGPs after maternal sevoflurane exposure. METHODS: Pregnant mice were exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 hours on gestational day 14.5. Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) of RGPs in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fetal brain was evaluated by thymidine analogues labelling. Cell fate of RGP progeny was determined by immunostaining using various neural markers. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess the neurocognitive behaviours of the offspring. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for the potential mechanism, and the potential mechanism validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and rescue experiments. Furthermore, INM was examined in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids. RESULTS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure induced temporary abnormities in INM, and disturbed the cell cycle progression of RGPs in both rodents and cerebral organoids without cell fate alternation. RNA-Seq analysis, qPCR and Western blot showed that the Notch signalling pathway was a potential downstream target. Reactivation of Notch by Jag1 and NICD overexpression rescued the defects in INM. Young adult offspring showed no obvious cognitive impairments in MWM. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure during neurogenic period temporarily induced abnormal INM of RGPs by targeting the Notch signalling pathway without inducing long-term effects on RGP progeny cell fate or offspring cognitive behaviours. More importantly, the defects of INM in hESC-derived cerebral organoids provide a novel insight into the effects of general anaesthesia on human brain development.",2021,Cell Prolif,"Jiang, Ming; Tang, Tianxiang; Liang, Xinyue; Li, Juchen; Qiu, Yue; Liu, Shiwen; Bian, Shan; Xie, Yunli; Fang, Fang; Cang, Jing"
"Assessment of pain during application of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure and heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannulae in preterm infants.","OBJECTIVE To assess pain and compare its severity in preterm infants during application of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC). STUDY DESIGN An observational cross-sectional study. Sixty preterm infants, categorized into nCPAP (n=37) and HHHFNC groups (n=23). Pain response was assessed using Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), duration of first cry and salivary-cortisol concentrations. RESULT The PIPP scores were significantly higher in the nCPAP compared with HHHFNC group (10 (7-12) vs 4 (2-6), P<0.01). None of the infants in the HHHFNC group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score >12, compared with 5 (13.5%) infants in the nCPAP group. Salivary-cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in nCPAP group compared with the HHHFNC group (5.0 (3.6-5.9) vs 1.6 (1.0-2.3) nmol l(-1), P<0.01). A lower incidence of cry was observed for infants in the HHHFNC group compared with the nCPAP group (11 (47.8%) vs 30 (81.1%), P<0.001), however, the duration of first cry was not significantly different between groups. The respiratory rate was significantly lower after application of HHHFNC compared with nCPAP (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) and heart rate. CONCLUSION The application of HHHFNC in preterm infants is associated with less pain compared with nCPAP, as it is associated with less PIPP scores and lower salivary-cortisol concentrations.",2015,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,"Osman, M; Elsharkawy, A; Abdel-Hady, H"
Impact of antibacterials on subsequent resistance and clinical outcomes in adult patients with viral pneumonia: an opportunity for stewardship,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as significant etiologies of pneumonia among hospitalized patients. Advanced technologies using multiplex molecular assays and polymerase-chain reaction increase the ability to identify viral pathogens and may ultimately impact antibacterial use. METHOD: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of antibacterials in viral pneumonia on clinical outcomes and subsequent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections/colonization. Patients admitted from March 2013 to November 2014 with positive respiratory viral panels (RVP) and radiographic findings of pneumonia were included. Patients transferred from an outside hospital or not still hospitalized 72 hours after the RVP report date were excluded. Patients were categorized based on exposure to systemic antibacterials: less than 3 days representing short-course therapy and 3 to 10 days being long-course therapy. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients (long-course, n = 67; short-course, n = 28; mixed bacterial-viral infection, n = 79) were included with most being immunocompromised (56.3 %) with active malignancy the primary etiology (69.4 %). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (23 %), Influenza (19 %), and Parainfluenza (15.5 %) were the viruses most commonly identified. A total of 13 different systemic antibacterials were used as empiric therapy in the 95 patients with pure viral infection for a total of 466 days-of-therapy. Vancomycin (50.7 %), cefepime (40.3 %), azithromycin (40.3 %), meropenem (23.9 %), and linezolid (20.9 %) were most frequently used. In-hospital mortality did not differ between patients with viral pneumonia in the short-course and long-course groups. Subsequent infection/colonization with a MDRO was more frequent in the long-course group compared to the short-course group (53.2 vs 21.1 %; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study found that long-course antibacterial use in the setting of viral pneumonia had no impact on clinical outcomes but increased the incidence of subsequent MDRO infection/colonization.",2015-11-18,Crit Care,"Crotty, Matthew P.; Meyers, Shelby; Hampton, Nicholas; Bledsoe, Stephanie; Ritchie, David J.; Buller, Richard S.; Storch, Gregory A.; Kollef, Marin H.; Micek, Scott T."

Bioluminescence technologies to detect calicivirus protease activity in cell-free system and in infected cells,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an important veterinary pathogen and causes respiratory disease in cats. Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET(2)). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET(2)-based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET(2)-based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET(2)-based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET(2) signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET(2)-based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect FCV protease activity induced in infected cells, and well worth consideration for screening of anti-FCV protease compounds in cell-free system as well as anti-FCV compounds in cultured cells.",2011-02-11,Antiviral Res,"Oka, Tomoichiro; Takagi, Hirotaka; Tohya, Yukinobu; Murakami, Kosuke; Takeda, Naokazu; Wakita, Takaji; Katayama, Kazuhiko"
[Depiction of cardiovascular surgery in the current modified German DRG system 2021]./ Abbildung der Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie im aktuellen aG-DRG-System 2021,"Introduction: The year 2020 will always stand in the shadow of the pandemic triggered by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery. In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions. Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK). This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G­DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery. Methods: Analysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G­DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: Expansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses (ICD-10-GM 2021) and procedures (OPS 2021) lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery. Within the framework of the adaptation of the G­DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G­DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly important. Conclusion: For cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds. Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable. A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment. In this respect, the catalogue for outpatient operations in hospitals (AOP), which is expected in 2022 and will presumably be much expanded, will once again clearly increase the enforcement of outpatient performance of services that were previously performed as inpatient treatment.",2021,Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,"Franz, Dominik; Wenke, Andreas; Roeder, Norbert"
Mesenchymal stem cells derived from perinatal tissues for treatment of critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients: a case series,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There are a few reports of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential treatment for ARDS. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we present the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of the multiple infusions of high dose MSCs, which originated from the placenta and umbilical cord, in critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A total of 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-induced ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals enrolled in this study. The patients were critically ill with severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. The patients received three intravenous infusions (200 × 10(6) cells) every other day for a total of 600 × 10(6) human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs; 6 cases) or placental MSCs (PL-MSCs; 5 cases). FINDINGS: There were eight men and three women who were 42 to 66 years of age. Of these, six (55%) patients had comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cardiomyopathy (CMP). There were no serious adverse events reported 24–48 h after the cell infusions. We observed reduced dyspnea and increased SpO2 within 48–96 h after the first infusion in seven patients. Of these seven patients, five were discharged from the ICU within 2–7 days (average: 4 days), one patient who had signs of acute renal and hepatic failure was discharged from the ICU on day 18, and the last patient suddenly developed cardiac arrest on day 7 of the cell infusion. Significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α; P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01) were seen in all six survivors. IL-6 levels decreased in five (P = 0.06) patients and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels decreased in four (P = 0.14) patients. Four patients who had signs of multi-organ failure or sepsis died in 5–19 days (average: 10 days) after the first MSC infusion. A low percentage of lymphocytes (< 10%) and leukocytosis were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). All six survivors were well with no complaints of dyspnea on day 60 post-infusion. Radiological parameters of the lung computed tomography (CT) scans showed remarkable signs of recovery. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that multiple infusions of high dose allogeneic prenatal MSCs are safe and can rapidly improve respiratory distress and reduce inflammatory biomarkers in some critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS cases. Patients that develop sepsis or multi-organ failure may not be good candidates for stem cell therapy. Large randomized multicenter clinical trials are needed to discern the exact therapeutic potentials of MSC in COVID-19-induced ARDS.

Covid-19 Detection Using Advanced CNN and X-rays,"As the Covid-19 pandemic surfaced worldwide, various newer technologies came ahead to help humanity to survive and live a better life. While medical science worked on vaccine development, Artificial intelligence and advanced computing helped in segregating millions of drugs to counter this novel coronavirus disease. Deep learning also came up with an alternative detection model. In this work, we present the detection method with computer vision using advanced CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and architecture used is VGGNet. Since the virus is a new variant of the coronavirus also named as SARS-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) by WHO (World Health Organization), requires a different technique for testing and detection. The detection procedure used to take too much time to confirm the infection. The techniques utilized to this point of time is limited and which creates an impossible type of situation to test a huge crowd of the population like India. So, it’s high time to come up with an alternative system for the Covid-19 Tests. Hence this paper came up with detection and partial confirmation of Covid-19 using X-ray images by applying a deep learning Algorithm. By enhancing the images and classifying the features we can easily differentiate between Covid-19 affected people and Normal people X-ray images of the chest. This pandemic highly affects our lungs, X-ray images may be one of the viable options.",2021-03-21,Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,"Behera, Basudeba; Kumar, Nitish; Mahato, Mukesh Ranjan; Kumar, Ajay"

"Tourism Industry in Russia and Global Covid-19 Pandemic: Threats, Counteractions, Trends","The present paper is dedicated to COVID-19 pandemic impact that manifested itself around the world since the end of 2019 and significantly affected the tourism and hospitality industry. In Russia and in the world, tourism is among industries the most affected by the consequences of restrictions and anti-epidemiological measures against COVID-19. The article divides the examples of mechanisms for overcoming the epidemic consequences in tourism, developed by different states and in Russia, in 9 groups (categories), and considers them in a comparative aspect. COVID-19 exacerbated relationship problems between two main subjects of the tourism market - tour operators and travel agents. Numerous mechanisms of government supporting Russian tourism industry do not work to the full and are not effective enough. The article discusses these problems, highlights the main trends and prospects of the tourism industry in Russia and in the world, and tries to outline the contours of the ""post-.ovid"" future of the tourism sector. The industry is in deep crisis, but at the same time, it expects new breakthrough ideas and technologies, creative solutions and non-standard proposals. Probably, the tourism projects, formed on these foundations and mechanisms, will become new drivers of industry growth after the end of the pandemic.",2021,Anais Brasileiros De Estudos Turisticos-Abet,"Afanasiev, O.

Flow Cytometric Detection of Procoagulant Properties of Plasma from Patients with Clinically Confirmed Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia,"Background: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a severe prothrombotic complication of adenoviral vaccines including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. The putative mechanism involves formation of pathological anti-PF4 antibodies that activate platelets via the FcγRIIa receptor to drive thrombosis and the associated thrombocytopenia. Functional assays are important in the VITT diagnostic pathway as not all detectable PF4 antibodies are pathogenic. Detection of procoagulant platelets (platelets supporting thrombin generation) in presence of PF4 has been proposed as a diagnostic assay for VITT (Althaus et al). Procoagulant platelets are not typically generated in response to low level agonist stimulation;however, combination of ligand binding of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) (eg. PAR1) and ITAM linked receptors (eg. GPVI, CLEC2 and FcγRIIa) synergistically induce procoagulant platelet formation. Here, we describe an alternative flow cytometric assay to diagnose VITT. We hypothesized that priming of platelets with a PAR1 agonist at a level sufficient to release PF4, but insufficient to generate a significant procoagulant response in donor platelets, would provide a platform in which procoagulant response would be dependent on presence of FcγRIIa dependent procoagulant antibodies in patient plasma, without requirement for additional PF4. Methods: Our previously established flow cytometry-based procoagulant platelet assay (using cell death marker GSAO and P-selectin) was modified to incorporate exogenous patient plasma and performed on whole blood from healthy donors screened for FcγRIIa responsiveness (aggregation response to anti-CD9 antibody, ALB6), primed with 5 μM SFLLRN. The assay was performed on Australian patients referred for confirmatory VITT testing with probable VITT (confirmed thrombosis within 4-42 days of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination, D-Dimer > 5x ULN, platelets < 150 x 10 9/L or falling platelet count) after screening on PF4/heparin ELISA (Asserachrom HPIA IgG Assay, Stago Diagnostics). Procoagulant response was also measured in presence of 0.5 U/mL and 100 U/mL heparin, monoclonal FcγRIIa blocking antibody, IV.3, and intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIg. Some plasmas were incubated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Flow cytometry positive patients were also tested by serotonin release assay (SRA) and multiplate aggregometry. Clinical correlation was obtained. Results: Citrated plasma from 49 unique patients with suspected VITT are reported. Plasma from ELISA+ve patients with clinical picture consistent with VITT (n=31), significantly increased the procoagulant platelet proportions in healthy donors in presence of 5 μM SFLLRN (p<0.0001, Figure 1A). This increase was not seen with plasma from healthy donors (n=14);or individuals exposed to ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine without VITT: thrombocytopenic thrombosis patients who were ELISA-ve and SRA-ve (n=14);or low-level ELISA+ve patients without thrombocytopenia who were negative by either multiplate or SRA (n=4). The procoagulant platelet response induced by VITT positive plasma was reduced with low dose heparin (0.5 U/mL, p<0.01) except for 3 patients who showed a heparin-enhancing effect (Figure 1B). High dose heparin (100 U/mL, p<0.0001), IV.3 (10 µg/mL, p<0.0001) or IVIg (10 mg/mL, p<0.0001) abolished the procoagulant response (Figures 1C-D). The in vitro effect of IVIg was predictive of the in vivo response to IVIg therapy (Figure 1E). Addition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had no effect on the procoagulant platelet response. ChAdOx1 nCov-19 had an inconsistent effect on procoagulant platelet formation in presence of VITT plasma. Use of donors without a robust aggregation response to ALB6 resulted in false negative results. Conclusion: Induction of FcγRIIa dependent procoagulant response by patient plasma, suppressible by high dose heparin and IVIg, is highly indicative of VITT in the correct clinical circumstance. This assay modification of priming donor platelets from known FcγRIIa responsive donors ith a GPCR agonist to potentiate the ITAM signaling from platelet activating immune complexes, results in a sensitive and specific assay. This may represent a functional platform that can be adopted into diagnostic laboratories to identify patients with platelet-activating antibodies and potentially predict treatment responses.

COVID-19 Ruptures And Disruptions on Grieving And Mourning Within an African Context: Lessons For Social Work Practice,"Losing a significant other through death is a tragic experience worsened by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To curb this massive increase of deaths, the South African government introduced various rules to regulate the burial process. However, these COVID-19 regulations have caused major ruptures and disruptions on how bereaved families observe and practice cultural rites and customs following death within an African context. Consequently, many bereaved family members, particularly Black Africans, struggle with adhering to the regulations and funerals have been coined ‘super spreaders’ of the virus. The concerns raised in this article are twofold, namely, the impact of the Covid-19 regulations on how Black Africans grieve and mourn, as well as the involvement of social workers in formulating regulations that ought to be adhered to. This article explores the fissures and bricolages brought about by COVID-19, ultimately suggesting possible ways of dealing the losses ascribed to the pandemic.",2022-02-01,Omega (Westport),"Kgadima, Phuti N.; Leburu, Goitseone E."

Septic shock complicated by disseminated herpes simplex virus-1 infection: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Herpes virus remains dormant in human cells and could reactivate under immunosuppressed conditions, such as prolonged critical illnesses. The phenomenon of viral replication during intensive care is well known, even in patients without a history of immunosuppression, but it usually does not have a clinical impact. Systemic reactivation leads to viral DNA in blood. It remains unclear whether this replication is a marker of morbimortality or a true pathogenic process. Therefore, it is unclear what medical treatment is most appropriate for simple replication. In organ damage suspected to be induced by herpes virus, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment duration. Here, we report a rarely described case of multiorgan failure implicating herpes simplex virus and discuss its treatment. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old Caucasian immunosuppressed woman was admitted to the intensive care unit for septic shock. She presented pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two weeks after admission, she showed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome and circulation failure. She had digestive and cutaneous lesions typical of herpes simplex virus 1. Blood and respiratory polymerase chain reaction was strongly herpes simplex virus-1 positive. No other bacteria, fungi, or viruses were found. The evolution was rapidly favorable after the initiation of antiviral treatment. Treatment was stopped after 3 weeks of well-conducted antiviral therapy. Curative-dose treatment was interrupted despite continuous strongly positive blood polymerase chain reaction results. In this context, prophylactic treatment was continued. CONCLUSION: We report an exceptional presentation of multiorgan failure in the intensive care unit due to herpes simplex virus-1. The diagnosis was made based on typical herpes simplex virus-1 visceral lesions and the absence of other responsible microorganisms. Intense viral replication is a key diagnostic element. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment duration, but such decisions should not be based on blood polymerase chain reaction.",2021-08-08,J Med Case Rep,"Boquet, Amélie; Boulay, Guillaume; Hautin, Etienne; Mottard, Nicolas"
Pathophysiology of Brain Injury and Neurological Outcome in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Scoping Review of Preclinical to Clinical Studies,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been associated with secondary acute brain injury (ABI). However, there is sparse literature on the mechanism of lung-mediated brain injury and prevalence of ARDS-associated secondary ABI. We aimed to review and elucidate potential mechanisms of ARDS-mediated ABI from preclinical models and assess the prevalence of ABI and neurological outcome in ARDS with clinical studies. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and five other databases reporting ABI and ARDS through July 6, 2020 and included studies with ABI and neurological outcome occurring after ARDS. We found 38 studies (10 preclinical studies with 143 animals; 28 clinical studies with 1175 patients) encompassing 9 animal studies (n = 143), 1 in vitro study, 12 studies on neurocognitive outcomes (n = 797), 2 clinical observational studies (n = 126), 1 neuroimaging study (n = 15), and 13 clinical case series/reports (n = 15). Six ARDS animal studies demonstrated evidence of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage within the hippocampus. Five animal studies demonstrated altered cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure with the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation. High frequency of ARDS-associated secondary ABI or poor neurological outcome was observed ranging 82–86% in clinical observational studies. Of the clinically reported ABIs (median age 49 years, 46% men), the most common injury was hemorrhagic stroke (25%), followed by hypoxic ischemic brain injury (22%), diffuse cerebral edema (11%), and ischemic stroke (8%). Cognitive impairment in patients with ARDS (n = 797) was observed in 87% (range 73–100%) at discharge, 36% (range 32–37%) at 6 months, and 30% (range 25–45%) at 1 year. Mechanisms of ARDS-associated secondary ABI include primary hypoxic ischemic injury from hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary injury, such as lung injury induced neuroinflammation, and increased intracranial pressure from ARDS lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy. In summary, paucity of clinical data exists on the prevalence of ABI in patients with ARDS. Hemorrhagic stroke and hypoxic ischemic brain injury were commonly observed. Persistent cognitive impairment was highly prevalent in patients with ARDS.

Does aeroallergen sensitivity and allergic rhinitis in children cause milder COVID-19 infection?,"Background: There are conflicting data with regard to the impact of respiratory and allergic comorbidities on the course of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between allergic diseases and COVID-19 severity in pediatric patients. Methods: Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy/immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved. Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed. Results: A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated. COVID-19 was asymptomatic/mild in 44 patients and moderate/severe/critical in 31 patients. Based on allergy evaluation, allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients (25.3%), asthma in 10 patients (13%), and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients (4%). Aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in 26 patients (34.7%). COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic/mild in 15 patients with allergic rhinitis (78.9%) and in 21 with aeroallergen sensitivity (80.8%) (p = 0.038 and p = 0.005, respectively). There was no difference in severity between the patients with and without asthma (p = 0.550). The median (interquartile range) total IgE level was significantly higher in the asymptomatic/mild group (71.8 [30.7-211.2]) (p = 0.015). There were no differences in terms of spirometry parameters. Conclusion: Aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis in children may be associated with a milder course of COVID-19. The knowledge that atopy is associated with less-severe COVID-19 outcomes in children may guide clinical risk classification.",2021,Allergy Asthma Proc,"Vezir, Emine; Hizal, Mina; Cura Yayla, Burcu; Aykac, Kubra; Yilmaz, Arzu; Kaya, Gamze; Oygar, Pembe Derin; Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Ceyhan, Mehmet"
Prevalence of dysmenorrhea and associated factors among students in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common gynecological complaints among adolescent women. It has been associated with short-term absenteeism in school and has a negative impact on academic and daily activities. Therefore, the aim of the study was to show the evidence on the magnitude and correlates of dysmenorrhea in Ethiopia. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the literature from different databases such as PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library. We also used unpublished literature from Google, Google Scholar. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were extracted using a Microsoft Excel data extraction format. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for data analysis. To assess the heterogeneity of the primary articles, the Cochrane Q test statistics and the I2 test were carried out. Publication bias was inspected by funnel plot, and Egger's test was performed to confirm the presence of publication bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of dysmenorrhea and its associated factors. RESULT: A total of 12 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among female students in Ethiopia is 71.69% (66.82%-76.56%). In our systematic review, among factors associated with dysmenorrhea, the family history of dysmenorrhea was frequently reported in included studies. Therefore, dysmenorrhea was significantly associated with a family history of dysmenorrhea (adjusted odds ratio = 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.80-7.85)). CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among students was much higher in Ethiopia. Health professionals and teachers should educate and support students to follow their menstrual cycle regularly in the event of irregular periods. There should be an awareness of the negative consequences of dysmenorrhea to reduce the physical and psychological stresses that affect women and their families.",2022,Womens Health (Lond),"Molla, Alemayehu; Duko, Bereket; Girma, Bekahegn; Madoro, Derebe; Nigussie, Jemberu; Belayneh, Zelalem; Mengistu, Nebiyu; Mekuriaw, Birhanie"
Transcriptome analysis and association mapping revealed the genetic regulatory network response to cadmium stress in Populus tomentosa,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses, however, the lncRNA-mediated genetic networks response to cadmium (Cd) treatment remain elusive in trees, the promising phytoremediation candidates for Cd contamination. Here, we identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Populus tomentosa under Cd treatment. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, unveiling Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We then focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. LncRNAs genotype analysis and heterologous overexpressing PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their positive effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses. Our study provides the genetic basis for Populus response to Cd treatment, facilitating genetic improvement of enhancing Cd tolerance in trees.",2020,,"Quan, Mingyang; Liu, Xin; Xiao, Liang; Chen, Panfei; Song, Fangyuan; Lu, Wenjie; Song, Yuepeng; Zhang, Deqiang"
Violating Food System Workers' Rights in the Time of Covid-19: the Quest for State Accountability,"Food system workers, accounting for nearly one-third of the global workforce, are vital to the universal realization of the right to food, yet face formidable barriers to the realization of their own rights Despite state obligations to protect, respect, and fulfil the rights of workers under international human rights law, gaps in legal frameworks and lack of political will have left food system workers exposed to discrimination and abuse at the hands of private actors Migrant workers, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, in particular, face targeted exploitation without redress Case studies demonstrate the extent of this harm, even as governments designate workers as ""essential"" during the COVID-19 pandemic The authors of this article argue that deliberate inaction by states to extend meaningful protections to workers or indict exploitative actors demonstrates the need for a new state crime-one that holds accountable governments that are complicit in the grave violations of workers' fundamental rights",2021,State Crime,"Elver, H.; Shapiro, M."

Hepatitis C virus epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies in Igs prepared from human plasma,"Neutralizing antibodies directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are present in Igs made from anti-HCV-positive plasma. However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412–419 (epitope I) and 434–446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.",2007-05-15,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Zhang, Pei; Wu, Charles G.; Mihalik, Kathleen; Virata, Maria Luisa; Yu, Mei-ying W.; Alter, Harvey J.; Feinstone, Stephen M."

Clinical Evaluation of BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A+B Assay for Point-Of-Care System,"Differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or influenza (flu) at point of care is critical for efficient patient management and treatment of both these diseases. The study presented here characterizes the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A+B (“Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu”) triplex assay. The performance for SARS-CoV-2 detection was determined using 298 specimens from patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms within 7 days from symptom onset (DSO) in comparison with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) assay (“Lyra SARS-CoV-2”) as the reference. The performance for flu A and flu B detection was determined using 75 influenza-positive and 40 influenza-negative retrospective specimens in comparison with the previously FDA-cleared BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B assay (“Veritor Flu”) as the reference. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay met the FDA EUA acceptance criteria (86.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.8 to 93.1) for SARS-CoV-2 testing compared to Lyra SARS-CoV-2. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay also demonstrated 100% agreement with the Veritor Flu for Flu A+B assay. For flu A detection, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 91.2%; for flu B detection, the lower bound was 90.0%. The dual detection capability of Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu for the etiologic agents causing COVID-19 and flu will allow efficient differentiation between the two illnesses, inform disease management, and facilitate optimal treatment. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 and flu are two respiratory illnesses which share similar clinical symptoms. The BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B, the two etiologic agents causing COVID-19 and flu, respectively. This dual detection capability is critical when overlap occurs between the COVID-19 pandemic and the flu season. This triplex assay will allow efficient differentiation between the two respiratory illnesses and support a point-of-care physician diagnosis to facilitate the proper treatment and disease management for patients exhibiting overlapping symptoms.",2022-04-12,Microbiol Spectr,"Christensen, Katherine; Ren, Huimiao; Chen, Shirley; Cooper, Charles K.; Young, Stephen"
Citizen science initiative points at childhood BCG vaccination as a risk factor for COVID-19,"Current results do not provide conclusive evidence on the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 alone or in combination with other factors. To address this limitation, in this study we used a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 pandemic to collect data worldwide during 2 October 2020-30 October 2020 (1,233 individuals) in a structured way for analysing factors and characteristics of affected individuals in relation to BCG vaccination. For the first time, the results of our study suggested that vaccination with BCG may increase the risk for COVID-19 at certain age, particularly in individuals vaccinated at childhood. Childhood BCG vaccination increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with COVID-19 fivefold in COVID-19 low-incidence countries and threefold in high-incidence countries. A reasonable explanation for this effect is the activation of certain innate immunity mechanisms associated with inflammatory reactions. These factors should be considered when analysing the risks associated with this global pandemic.",2021,Transbound. emerg. dis.

Rapid Dissemination of a COVID-19 Airway Management Simulation Using a Train-the-Trainers Curriculum,"The most effective way to train clinicians to safely don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE) and perform aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), such as intubations, is unknown when clinician educators are unavailable, as they have been during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre–post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers’ comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners’ skill retention. Future work will focus on implementing similar train-the-trainers strategies for other health professions, specialties, and high-risk or rare procedures.",2021-04-13,Acad Med,"Peterson, William J.; Munzer, Brendan W.; Tucker, Ryan V.; Losman, Eve D.; Harvey, Carrie; Hatton, Colman; Sefa, Nana; Bassin, Ben S.; Hsu, Cindy H."

Cross-sectional genomic perspective of epidemic waves of SARS-CoV-2: A pan India study,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has posed unforeseen circumstances and throttled major economies worldwide. India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim for pan Indian cross-sectional evolutionary analysis since inception of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: High quality genomes, along with their collection date till 26th July 2021, were downloaded. Whole genome-based phylogeny was obtained. Further, the mutational analysis was performed using SARS-CoV-2 first reported from Wuhan (NC_045512.2) as reference. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven phases. The average mutation rate for the pre-first wave was <11, which elevated to 17 in the first wave and doubled in the second wave (∼34). In accordance with mutation rate, VOCs and VOIs started appearing in the first wave (1.5%), which dominated the second (∼96%) and post-second wave (100%). Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted >0.5 million mutation events with four major mutations in >19,300 genomes, including two mutations in coding (spike (D614G), and NSP 12b (P314L) of rdrp), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one extragenic mutation (5′ UTR 241). CONCLUSION: Whole genome-based phylogeny could demarcate post-first wave isolates from previous ones by point of diversification leading to incidences of VOCs and VOIs in India.

Catching Ghosts and Consecrating the Forgotten: The Seen and Unseen in the Work of Diane Victor,"Since pre-history, humankind has relied on archetypes and myths to describe the ineffable and has made use of fictional and mythological narratives to understand the meaning of life and death. Dying and death are topics reluctantly discussed in open society. Yet, the global COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the process of dying and death, and hence the survival of humankind. By embracing their finitude, humans attempt to create meaningful experiences in life and, therefore, attain “freedom towards death” (Heidegger, 1962: 311). This paper investigates how South African artist Diane Victor uses universally known myths and symbols of Christian iconography within a South African context to create meaning, as well as how she uses medium and exhibition sites to evoke intense emotions within viewers urging them to consider their finitude. By recognising how fragile and vulnerable life is, the artist captures the ephemeral in a poignant way. In this paper, I argue that Victor embraces the challenge of consecrating the forgotten or lost. Through incorporating religious icons, signs, and symbols in her work, Victor ‘catches ghosts’ of the ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ in, about, of and from South Africa. Her works are understood through a contemporary reading of religious (Christian) iconography and interpreted in the symbolic and fragile mediums of smoke, stain, ash, charcoal, light and shadow, emphasising the ephemerality and impermanence of the human condition. © 2021.

Large is different: non-monotonic behaviour of elastic range scaling in polymeric turbulence at large Reynolds and Deborah numbers,"We use high resolution direct numerical simulations to study statistically stationary, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulent flows of dilute solutions of polymers at high Reynolds numbers and Deborah numbers. We find that for small wavenumbers $k$, the kinetic energy spectrum shows Kolmogorov--like behavior which crosses over at a larger $k$ to a novel, elastic scaling regime, $E(q) \sim k^{-\xi}$, with $\xi \approx 2.3$, providing support to and extending the analysis of recent experimental results [Yi-Bao Zhang et. al., Science Advances 7, eabd3525 (2021)]. We uncover the mechanism of elastic scaling by studying the contribution of the polymers to the flux of kinetic energy through scales.The contribution can be decomposed into two parts: one, expected, increase in effective viscous dissipation of the flow and two, a purely elastic contribution that dominates over the nonlinear flux in the range of $k$ over which the elastic scaling is observed. The multiscale balance between the two fluxes determines the crossover wavenumber which, intriguingly, depends non-monotically on the Deborah number. The probability distribution function of polymer extension also depends non-monotonically on the Deborah number. Consistent with this picture, real space structure functions also show two scaling ranges, with intermittency present in both of them in equal measure.",2021-11-22,,"Rosti, Marco E; Perlekar, Prasad; Mitra, Dhrubaditya"

"COVID-19 and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4): SARS-CoV-2 May Bind and Activate TLR4 to Increase ACE2 Expression, Facilitating Entry and Causing Hyperinflammation","Causes of mortality from COVID-19 include respiratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis/multiorgan failure. TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4.",2021-01-14,Mediators Inflamm,"Aboudounya, Mohamed M.; Heads, Richard J."
"A rathole: Foucault, freud, and the problem of isolation","The article discusses the problem of isolation and draws a parallel between two different approaches to it — Michel Foucault’s archeology of power and Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis Foucault’s perspective is exemplified by his critique of the strategies of power as they were applied to the epidemics of leprosy and bubonic plague For leprosy there was an undifferentiated exclusionary space, while the the plague brought about a segmented space for confinement The passage from the one strategy to the other marks the development of the disciplinary model of power: leper colonies are transformed into prisons and psychiatric wards Freud’s approach is examined in his treatment of the Rat Man, the patient whose analysis prompted Freud to formulate his theory of obsessional neurosis, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) The article emphasizes the relevance of the problem of OCD to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 The traditional strategy of power applied to leprosy was isolation by means of exile from towns, while for the plague isolation meant shutting towns down with their inhabitants each in their own place as if imprisoned COVID-19 brought about a new strategy of self-isolation which entails creating physical and psychological barriers together with social distancing Obsessional neurosis is evolv-ing from an individual pathology into a kind of collective one: epidemiology influ-ences mentality In conclusion, the article takes up two literary examples — Roman Mikhailov’s text “The Wrong Side of a Rat,” and Varlam Shalamov’s story “Lepers,” from the Kolyma Stories collection — in which breaking out of isolation, disease and infection are presented as alternative affective experiences © 2021, Gaidar Institute Press All rights reserved",2021,Logos (Russian Federation),"Timofeeva, O."
Probiotics-Derived Peptides and Their Immunomodulatory Molecules Can Play a Preventive Role Against Viral Diseases Including COVID-19,"As of recent, the pandemic episode of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome brought about by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) expanding the pace of mortality, has affected the disease rate profoundly. Invulnerability is the fundamental choice to prevent the ruining event of COVID-19, as the drugs and antibodies are in the phase of preliminary clinical trials. Within this brief period, a few strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been recognized by the vaccine manufacturers, which could be an incorrect guess about the strain that will end up spreading. Since the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to mutate, immunizations, if at all works, might be for a restricted time. We have not put sufficient time in research to understand the immune responses that correlate with protection as this could help refine vaccines. Here, we have summed up the adequacy of the immunomodulatory component of probiotics for the prevention against viral infections. Furthermore, an in silico data have been provided in support of the “probiotics-derived lipopeptides” role in inactivating spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor molecule, ACE2. Among well characterized lipopeptides derived from different probiotic strains, subtilisin (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), curvacin A (Lactobacillus curvatus), sakacin P (Lactobacillus sakei), lactococcin Gb (Lactococcus lactis) was utilized in this study to demonstrate a higher binding proclivity to S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2. The outcome revealed noteworthy capabilities of the lipopeptides, due to their amphiphilic nature, to bind spike protein and receptor molecule, which may act to competitively inhibit the mandatory interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host epithelial cell expressing ACE2 for its entry into the cell for reproduction. In the current situation, probiotic treatment alongside chemotherapy may assist in bringing about substantial improvement of the health of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, probiotics may aid towards building up the immune defenses in people to evade COVID-19.

"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (ß = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.",2020,Brain Behav Immun,"Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun"
Beyond R(0): heterogeneity in secondary infections and probabilistic epidemic forecasting,"The basic reproductive number, R(0), is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R(0). Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R(0) and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R(0) can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R(0), heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R(0).",2020-11-04,J R Soc Interface,"Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine"

Role of multiplex PCR analysis in children with febrile seizures,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess multiplex PCR analysis in detecting causative viruses in children with febrile seizures. METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis comparing data from a pre-multiplex era (2009) with a period after the introduction of routine respiratory multiplex analysis (2010–2013) in children with febrile seizures. RESULTS: We included 200 children with febrile seizures (mean age: 29.5 ± 1.4.months; 104 male) in the study. In 2009, in 10 out of 49 (20 %) children, microbiology testing (bacterial/fungal) was positive compared with a rate of 74 out of 151 (49 %) children during 2010–2013 (p < 0.01). The rate of positive virological studies increased from 10 (20 %) in 2009 to 73 (48.3 %) in the period 2010–2013 (p < 0.01). Multiplex PCR analysis confirmed viral infections in 52 of 73 cases (71.2 %). CONCLUSION: Routine multiplex PCR analysis fosters the detection of respiratory viruses in children with febrile seizure. The precise role of multiplex analysis in the management of these children awaits further clarification.",2016-06-20,Wien Med Wochenschr,"Naric, Jelena; Rissland, Jürgen; Simon, Arne; Poryo, Martin; Gortner, Ludwig; Meyer, Sascha"

"Elective Tracheostomy During Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Affected by COVID-19: Preliminary Case Series From Lombardy, Italy.","The COVID-19 outbreak poses continued struggles due to the unprecedented number of patients admitted to intensive care units and the overwhelming need for mechanical ventilation. We report a preliminary case series of 32 patients with COVID-19 who underwent elective tracheostomies after a mean intubation period of 15 days (range, 9-21 days). The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques. Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed. Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed. The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.",2020-05-12,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,"Turri-Zanoni, Mario; Battaglia, Paolo; Czaczkes, Camilla; Pelosi, Paolo; Castelnuovo, Paolo; Cabrini, Luca"
A Queue Management Approach for Social Distancing and Contact Tracing,"Social distancing is necessary to prevent the rapid spread of a highly contagious disease, such as COVID-19, at least until a vaccine is found and mass-produced. By reducing the probability of an uninfected person coming close or in physical contact with an infected one, the disease transmission in the community can be suppressed. Although social distancing is simple to comprehend, it is not always easy to implement, mainly because not all public spaces are designed with this requirement in mind. In this paper, we present a queue management tool that can be used to allow people that wait for a service practice social distancing. In our approach, people are asked to join a virtual queue, in order to avoid crowds in physical waiting rooms or long waiting queues. Machine learning is used to predict the estimated waiting time of queuers, so they are called just in time to get served. We use past data and machine learning to predict how busy a location will be so that customers can pick the best time to visit the service. Finally, we present the method we use to monitor people taking a service at any time and implement contact tracing in a privacy-preserving manner.",2020,2020 Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Industries,"Kyritsis, A.

Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: Reported rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) have varied significantly among studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) published to date. The present meta-analysis was conducted to gain clarity regarding AKI incidence and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases were systematically searched for COVID-19-related case reports published through 25 July 2020. Pooled analyses were conducted using R. RESULTS: The pooled incidence of AKI in 51 studies including 21,531 patients was 12.3% (95% CI 9.5-15.6%), with higher rates of 38.9% in 290 transplant patients (95% CI 27.3-51.9%), 39.0% in 565 ICU patients (95% CI 23.2-57.6%) and 42.0% among 1745 deceased patients (95% CI 30.3-54.7%). RRT usage was reported in 39 studies of 17,664 patients, with an overall pooled use of 5.4% (95% CI 4.0-7.1%), with higher rates of 15.6% in 117 transplant patients (95%CI 9.9-23.8%) and 16.3% in 776 ICU patients (95% CI 11.1-23.3%). CONCLUSION: AKI and RRT use among COVID-19 patients represent a major public health concern, and early and appropriate intervention should be called upon to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from AKI.",2020,Int Immunopharmacol,"Yang, Xiaopeng; Tian, Shasha; Guo, Hui"
Revealing the activation mechanism of autoinhibited RalF by integrated simulation and experimental approaches.,"RalF is an Arf GEF from Legionella pneumophilia, the bacterium that causes severe pneumonia. In its crystal structure, RalF is in the autoinhibited form. A large-scale domain motion is expected to lift the autoinhibition, the mechanism of which is still unknown. Since RalF is activated in the presence of the membrane, its active structure and the structure of the RalF-Arf1 complex could not have been determined experimentally. On the simulation side, it has been proven that classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) alone is not efficient enough to map motions of such amplitude and determine the active conformation of RalF. In this article, using Molecular Dynamics with excited Normal Modes (MDeNM) combined with previous experimental findings we were able to determine the active RalF structure and the structure of the RalF-Arf1 complex in the presence of the membrane, bridging the gap between experiments and simulation.",2021-05-12,Scientific reports,"Dudas, Balint; Perahia, David; Balog, Erika"

Early Occurrence of Adverse Events in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 and Beneficial Effect of Anticoagulation.,"BACKGROUND/AIM This study analyzed the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 with major events during the first days of hospitalization. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients admitted to two hospitals in Athens, Greece. The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who suffered the primary endpoint (venous thromboembolic events, intubation, and death) during the first days of hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS Among 95 patients included in the analysis, 21 presented with major adverse events during a median follow-up of 13 days. More than 50% of these patients presented with a major event during the first 3 days. Anticoagulation treatment was inversely associated with the cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint [hazard ratio=0.16 (95% confidence interval=0.06-0.47)]. Patients with major events were older, with lower baseline SatO2, and higher number of Wells' criteria and Charlson comorbidity index. Among these patients, those with hypertension were at higher risk for early occurrence of events (≤ first three days of hospitalization). CONCLUSION Major adverse events may occur early in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a high-risk profile. Anticoagulation treatment appears to reduce this risk and thus prompt thromboprophylaxis should be employed in these patients.",2022,In vivo,"Dimakakos, Evangelos; Kollias, Anastasios; Rapti, Vasiliki; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Trontzas, Ioannis P; Abdelrasoul, Mahmoud M; Zanelli, Stavroula; Leontis, Konstantinos; Argyraki, Katerina; Dimakou, Katerina; Tsoukalas, Georgios; Athanasiou, Kalomira; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Syrigos, Konstantinos N; Poulakou, Garyphallia"
"Change in unemployment by social vulnerability among United States counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence—July 1–October 31, 2020","OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate in the United States peaked at 14.8% in April 2020. We examined patterns in unemployment following this peak in counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence. METHOD: We used CDC aggregate county data to identify counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence (rapid riser counties) during July 1–October 31, 2020. We used a linear regression model with fixed effect to calculate the change of unemployment rate difference in these counties, stratified by the county’s social vulnerability (an indicator compiled by CDC) in the two months before the rapid riser index month compared to the index month plus one month after the index month. RESULTS: Among the 585 (19% of U.S. counties) rapid riser counties identified, the unemployment rate gap between the most and least socially vulnerable counties widened by 0.40 percentage point (p<0.01) after experiencing a rapid rise in COVID-19 incidence. Driving the gap were counties with lower socioeconomic status, with a higher percentage of people in racial and ethnic minority groups, and with limited English proficiency. CONCLUSION: The widened unemployment gap after COVID-19 incidence rapid rise between the most and least socially vulnerable counties suggests that it may take longer for socially and economically disadvantaged communities to recover. Loss of income and benefits due to unemployment could hinder behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 (e.g., seeking healthcare) and could impede response efforts including testing and vaccination. Addressing the social needs within these vulnerable communities could help support public health response measures.",2022-04-20,PLoS One,"Tang, Shichao; Horter, Libby; Bosh, Karin; Kassem, Ahmed M.; Kahn, Emily B.; Ricaldi, Jessica N.; Pao, Leah Zilversmit; Kang, Gloria J.; Singleton, Christa-Marie; Liu, Tiebin; Thomas, Isabel; Rao, Carol Y."

Updated and Validated Pan-Coronavirus PCR Assay to Detect All Coronavirus Genera,"Coronavirus (CoV) spillover events from wildlife reservoirs can result in mild to severe human respiratory illness. These spillover events underlie the importance of detecting known and novel CoVs circulating in reservoir host species and determining CoV prevalence and distribution, allowing improved prediction of spillover events or where a human-reservoir interface should be closely monitored. To increase the likelihood of detecting all circulating genera and strains, we have modified primers published by Watanabe et al. in 2010 to generate a semi-nested pan-CoV PCR assay. Representatives from the four coronavirus genera (&#945;-CoVs, ß-CoVs, Î³-CoVs and Î´-CoVs) were tested and all of the in-house CoVs were detected using this assay. After comparing both assays, we found that the updated assay reliably detected viruses in all genera of CoVs with high sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity of the original assay was lower. Our updated PCR assay is an important tool to detect, monitor and track CoVs to enhance viral surveillance in reservoir hosts.",2021,Viruses,"Holbrook, Myndi G; Anthony, Simon J; Navarrete-Macias, Isamara; Bestebroer, Theo; Munster, Vincent J; van Doremalen, Neeltje"
"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting children's development. This rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and children's safety and security. There are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies' findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent and child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education. The findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies and those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint ""what works"" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-02-16,,"Proulx, K.; Lenzi-Weisbecker, R.; Rachel, R.; Hackett, K.; Cavallera, V.; Daelmans, B.; Dua, T."
Appraisal of systematic reviews on interventions for postpartum depression: systematic review.,"BACKGROUND Postpartum depression (PPD) is a highly prevalent mental health problem that affects parental health with implications for child health in infancy, childhood, adolescence and beyond. The primary aim of this study was to critically appraise available systematic reviews describing interventions for PPD. The secondary aim was to evaluate the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews and their conclusions. METHODS An electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2020 was conducted to identify systematic reviews that examined an intervention for PPD. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was utilized to independently score each included systematic review which was then critically appraised to better define the most effective therapeutic options for PPD. RESULTS Of the 842 studies identified, 83 met the a priori criteria for inclusion. Based on the systematic reviews with the highest methodological quality, we found that use of antidepressants and telemedicine were the most effective treatments for PPD. Symptoms of PPD were also improved by traditional herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Current evidence for physical exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in treating PPD remains equivocal. A significant, but weak relationship between AMSTAR score and journal impact factor was observed (p = 0.03, r = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.43) whilst no relationship was found between the number of total citations (p = 0.27, r = 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.09 to 0.34), or source of funding (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION Overall the systematic reviews on interventions for PPD are of low-moderate quality and are not improving over time. Antidepressants and telemedicine were the most effective therapeutic interventions for PPD treatment.",2021-01-06,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"Chow, Ryan; Huang, Eileen; Li, Allen; Li, Sophie; Fu, Sarah Y; Son, Jin S; Foster, Warren G"
Phone follow up to families of COVID-19 patients who died at the hospital: families' grief reactions and clinical psychologists' roles,"A proportion of persons affected by coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) die and do so in extraordinary circumstances. This can make grief management extremely challenging for families. The Clinical Psychology unit of an Italian hospital offered a bereavement follow-up call to such families. This study aimed to explore the families' experiences and needs collected during these calls, and the role that the psychologists played through the call. A total of 246 families were called over 3 months. Multiple qualitative methods included: (i) written reports of the calls with relatives of patients who died at the hospital for COVID-19; (ii) qualitative semi-structured interviews with psychologists involved in the calls; (iii) observation of psychologists' peer group discussions. A thematic analysis was conducted. Six themes emerged: without death rituals, solitary, unexpected, unfair, unsafe, coexisting with other stressors. Families' reactions were perceived by psychologists as close to a traumatic grief. Families' needs ranged from finding alternative rituals to giving meaning and expressing different emotions. The psychologists played both a social-institutional and a psychological-human role through the calls (e.g., they cured disrupted communication or validated feelings and choices). This study highlighted the potential of traumatic grief of families of COVID-19 victims, and provided indications for supporting them within the space of a short phone call.",2021,,"Menichetti Delor, Julia Paola; Borghi, Lidia; Cao di San Marco, Eugenia; Fossati, Ivan; Vegni, Elena"
"Post-entry, spike-dependent replication advantage of B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 over B.1 SARS-CoV-2 in an ACE2-deficient human lung cell line","Epidemiological data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 are more transmissible and infections are associated with a higher mortality than non-VOC virus infections. Phenotypic properties underlying their enhanced spread in the human population remain unknown. B.1.1.7 virus isolates displayed inferior or equivalent spread in most cell lines and primary cells compared to an ancestral B.1 SARS-CoV-2, and were outcompeted by the latter. Lower infectivity and delayed entry kinetics of B.1.1.7 viruses were accompanied by inefficient proteolytic processing of spike. B.1.1.7 viruses failed to escape from neutralizing antibodies, but slightly dampened induction of innate immunity. The bronchial cell line NCI-H1299 supported 24- and 595-fold increased growth of B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 viruses, respectively, in the absence of detectable ACE2 expression and in a spike-determined fashion.

Predictors of negative psychosocial and health behavior impact of COVID-19 among young adults,"Given the global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mental and physical health, we examined young adults’ changes in mental health, intimate relationship quality, alcohol use and weight-related behaviors during COVID-19 and their correlates (depressive symptoms, resilience, social context and COVID-19-related factors). We analyzed data from a longitudinal study of 1082 young adults across six metropolitan areas (M(age) = 24.76 ± 4.70; 51.8% female; 73.6% White and 12.5% Hispanic), using multivariate linear regressions for continuous outcomes (magnitude of mental health impact) and logistic regressions for categorical outcomes (decreased relationship quality, physical activity and nutrition and increased alcohol use and sedentary behavior). Of five negative mental health impacts assessed, participants reported experiencing an average of 3.54 (SD = 5.46), experiencing more correlated with increased childcare responsibilities and lower resilience. Additionally, 23.6% of those in relationships experienced negative relationship impact, 41.3% increased alcohol use, 47.2% decreased physical activity, 74.0% were more sedentary and 34.7% experienced poorer nutrition, all of which was predicted by greater depressive symptoms. Additionally, lower resilience predicted negative relationship impact and poorer nutrition and social context/roles correlated with various outcomes (e.g. relationships and alcohol use). Interventions to reduce negative health behaviors given societal stressors should address key psychosocial and situational factors, including depressive symptoms and resilience.",2021-07-01,Health Educ Res,"Romm, Katelyn F; Patterson, Brooke; Wysota, Christina N; Wang, Yan; Berg, Carla J"
The New Consumer Behaviour Paradigm amid COVID-19: Permanent or Transient?,"A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions with some aspects of behaviour being irrevocable. COVID-19 pandemic is not a normal crisis, and to control the spread of disease various measures were taken including complete and then partial lockdown. Since all elements of the economy are intricately interrelated with public health measures and lockdown, this resulted in economic instabilities of the nations hinting towards change in market dynamics. In every market, consumers are the drivers of the market competitiveness, growth and economic integration. With economic instability, consumers are also experiencing a transformation in behaviour, though how much of transformation experienced during the crisis will sustain is a question. This article looks at the consumer behaviour during COVID-19 crisis and in the subsequent lockdown period when the world stood still for more than a quarter of a year. Further, the article attempts to weave through the maze of literature available about consumer behaviour in normal times and in crisis times, strengthens it with the rapid assessment reports culled out by the different consulting organisations during lockdown phase, substantiates the same with first-hand telling and retelling of experiences by consumers and professionals with marketing background to bring up a hypothesis of the pandemic affecting a paradigm shift from consumer materialism to consumer spiritualism. The proposition offers further testable hypotheses for future research to understand consumer sentiments or requirement in buying ‘what is enough’ within the marketing context and how it can be reinforced post-COVID crisis for ensuring sustainability of business models. It would also be interesting to explore the correlates of this forced consumer behaviour with other variables such as learning from crisis, changing needs, personality, nationality, culture, new market segment and age to develop new models of consumer behaviour.",2020,J.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease and COVID-19: How Have Patients Coped So Far?,"OBJECTIVE: Knowledge about SARS-CoV2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is growing fast. Massive changes in the health care system imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly impact the overall quality of medical care. In this survey, we aim to explore experiences and concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding the current pandemic. METHODS: A 40-item web-based questionnaire on disease-related experiences and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic was made available to patients with IBD from 28 April 2020 to 31 July 2020. RESULTS: An increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection was a concern for 56.7% of the 1199 patients (aged 41.3±12.8, women 77%, Crohn's disease 58.8%, ulcerative colitis 38.5%); 61.7% feared an increased risk of severe disease course of COVID-19. Effective preventive measures in either outpatient practices or hospitals were observed by 84.7% of the patients. Appointments with an IBD specialist were canceled in 38.7%, frequently on the patients' initiative. Telecommunication visits were considered an acceptable alternative to personal visits by 71.0%. Medication was reduced or paused in 6.9% because of the pandemic. A swab (SARS-CoV2-PCR) was done in 13.2% of the patients; only 3 patients (0.25%) were tested positive. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern of patients with IBD. However, the cumulative prevalence in our cohort is low. Patients at risk should be identified and counseled individually. When required because of the local COVID-19 situation, telecommunication visits and liberal prescription policies are advisable to reduce in-person contacts, while ensuring continuous therapy and maintaining communication with patients.",2021,J. clin. gastroenterol,"Schlabitz, Franziska; Teich, Niels; Riesner-Wehner, Anica; Böhm, Sebastian; Greinert, Robin; Eisenmann, Stephan; Michl, Patrick; Walldorf, Jens"

LncRNA CCAT1 downregulation increases the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells,"This study aims to investigate if the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells can be regulated by long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) colon cancer associated transcript1 (CCAT1). CCAT1 was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in NSCLC cells (A549, H1299, SK-MES1, H460, and H647) and human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). H460 and A549 cells were then selected for the determination of CCAT1 expression after exposure to radiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24 h). Colony forming assay was performed to evaluate the effects of CCAT1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector on the radiosensitivity of H460 and A549 cells. Then, flow cytometry, western blotting and qRT-PCR were also conducted. CCAT1 was increased in NSCLC cells when compared with 16HBE cells, which was declined in a time- and dosage-dependent manner after exposure to radiation. The H460 and A549 cell colonies were decreased and the Î³-H2AX expression was elevated with the increase of radiation dosage, which was more obvious in those transfected with CCAT1 siRNA. CCAT1 downregulation arrested NSCLC cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the enhanced apoptosis of radiotherapy-treated NSCLC cells with reductions of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK was promoted by siCCAT1, but it was reversed by pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector. Inhibiting CCAT1 regulated cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis of NSCLC cells, and affected MAPK pathway, eventually improving the radiosensitivity of NSCLC.",2021,Kaohsiung j. med. sci.

Dysphagia Care Across the Continuum: A Multidisciplinary Dysphagia Research Society Taskforce Report of Service-Delivery During the COVID-19 Global Pandemic,"At the time of writing this paper, there are over 11 million reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Health professionals involved in dysphagia care are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in their day-to-day practices. Otolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, rehabilitation specialists, and speech-language pathologists are subject to virus exposure due to their proximity to the aerodigestive tract and reliance on aerosol-generating procedures in swallow assessments and interventions. Across the globe, professional societies and specialty associations are issuing recommendations about which procedures to use, when to use them, and how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during their use. Balancing safety for self, patients, and the public while maintaining adequate evidence-based dysphagia practices has become a significant challenge. This paper provides current evidence on COVID-19 transmission during commonly used dysphagia practices and provides recommendations for protection while conducting these procedures. The paper summarizes current understanding of dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and draws on evidence for dysphagia interventions that can be provided without in-person consults and close proximity procedures including dysphagia screening and telehealth.",2020,Dysphagia,"Miles, Anna; Connor, Nadine P; Desai, Rinki Varindani; Jadcherla, Sudarshan; Allen, Jacqui; Brodsky, Martin; Garand, Kendrea L; Malandraki, Georgia A; McCulloch, Timothy M; Moss, Marc; Murray, Joseph; Pulia, Michael; Riquelme, Luis F; Langmore, Susan E"
Women’s Healthcare Services since the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in Poland,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a direct impact on the extent of guaranteed healthcare services. Many gynecologists’, obstetricians’, and midwives’ offices were closed, laboratories suspended their activities, the collection of necessary tests was delayed, and women had to wait much longer for test results than they had to previously. General women’s healthcare prophylactic programs were suspended or delayed. In 2020, screening financed by public funds covered less than one-seventh of the female population in Poland. As medical teams, professionals, clinicians, and scientists, we have been facing a challenge to help, protect, and care for one of the most vulnerable population groups, pregnant women. A significant part of that challenge has been in preventing the spread of severe COVID-19, along with other preventable diseases, among women who are pregnant, who are in labor, or who have recently given birth.",2021-12-24,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Wszołek, Katarzyna; Pruski, Dominik; Tomczyk, Katarzyna; Kampioni, Małgorzata; Chmaj-Wierzchowska, Karolina; Przybylski, Marcin; Wilczak, Maciej"
Unfreezing unspent social special-purpose funds for the Covid-19 crisis: critical reflections from India,"Abstract In India, the government launched a US$22.6 billion financial support package for the poor and marginalized as a result of Covid-19. Approximately US$ 4.2 billion (INR 310 billion) from a vast pile of unspent social special-purpose funds. How and why did such a large volume of funds accumulate in the first place, and why did it take a public health emergency to release them? What might be the consequences of their use under these conditions - especially for our understanding of governance and accountability in social welfare provision? This paper presents a brief analysis of two preliminary case studies of specific social special-purpose funds in India. We rely on a handful of unstructured interviews and informal discussions with subnational government officials, civil society actors, trade union representatives, and local community leaders in January 2020, and that were pursued virtually following the lockdown. This is bolstered by analysis of primary documents, including Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) reports, relevant laws, and press reports. We argue that non-disbursement should be understood as a institutional matter, and not only as technical or implementation failure. Moreover, as such funds are likely to mushroom following Covid-19, our findings suggest that policymakers should focus on the institutional design, decision-making and accountability structures for the flow and distribution of Covid funds, rather than merely emphasising their collection.",2020-08-12,World Dev,"Desai, Deval; Randeria, Shalini"

Aerodynamic dispersion of respiratory droplets and aerosols by turbulent airflow,"The precautionary measures recommended during the current COVID-19 pandemic do not consider the effect of turbulent airflow. We found the propagation of droplets and aerosols highly affected by this condition. The spread of respiratory droplets by the action of sneezing is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: Larger droplets (300-900 µm) have a ballistic trajectory and can be spread up to 5 m, while a cloud of smaller droplets (100-200 µm) can be transported and dispersed at longer distances up to 18 m by the action of the turbulent airflow. In relation to the spread of exhaled aerosols during respiration, these remain in the air for long periods of time. In the presence of intense or moderate airflow, this set of particles follow airflow streamlines, and thus their propagation is directly determined by the air velocity field. Given the scientific evidence, these results should be considered in public debate about the aerodynamic dispersion characteristics of scenarios where social interactions occur and about the measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. © 2021 by the authors.

A Relaxation Algorithm for Optimal Control Problems Governed by Two-Dimensional Conservation Laws,"We develop a class of numerical methods for solving optimal control problems governed by nonlinear conservation laws in two space dimensions. The relaxation approximation is used to transform the nonlinear problem to a semi-linear diagonalizable system with source terms. The relaxing system is hyperbolic and it can be numerically solved without need to either Riemann solvers for space discretization or a non-linear system of algebraic equations solvers for time discretization. In the current study, the optimal control problem is formulated for the relaxation system and at the relaxed limit its solution converges to the relaxed equation of conservation laws. An upwind method is used for reconstruction of numerical fluxes and an implicit-explicit scheme is used for time stepping. Computational results are presented for a two-dimensional inviscid Burgers problem.",2020-05-25,Computational Science - ICCS 2020,"Herty, Michael; Salhi, Loubna; Seaid, Mohammed"
Guidelines for accurate genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 using amplicon-based sequencing of clinical samples,"Background SARS-CoV-2 genotyping has been instrumental to monitor virus evolution and transmission during the pandemic. The reliability of the information extracted from the genotyping efforts depends on a number of aspects, including the quality of the input material, applied technology and potential laboratory-specific biases. These variables must be monitored to ensure genotype reliability. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in studies of viral spread and evolution. Results We used clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes to evaluate the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination using an amplicon-based approach. We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the genome at frequencies of 10% or higher. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in >200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The genotypes of clinical isolates with viral load above the recommended threshold cluster by sampling location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequency of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two recently reported European strains whose dissemination was favoured by travelling during the summer 2020. Conclusions We present much-needed recommendations for reliable determination of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and demonstrate their broad applicability in a large cohort of clinical samples.",2020-12-03,bioRxiv,"Kubik, Slawomir; Marques, Ana Claudia; Xing, Xiaobin; Silvery, Janine; Bertelli, Claire; De Maio, Flavio; Pournaras, Spyros; Burr, Tom; Duffourd, Yannis; Siemens, Helena; Alloui, Chakib; Song, Lin; Wenger, Yvan; Saitta, Alexandra; Macheret, Morgane; Smith, Ewan W.; Menu, Philippe; Brayer, Marion; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Si-Mohammed, Ali; Chuisseu, Josiane; Stevens, Richard; Constantoulakis, Pantelis; Sali, Michela; Greub, Gilbert; Tiemann, Carsten; Pelechano, Vicent; Willig, Adrian; Xu, Zhenyu"
Protein conformational dynamics and phenotypic switching,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack rigid 3D structure but exist as conformational ensembles. Because of their structural plasticity, they can interact with multiple partners. The protein interactions between IDPs and their partners form scale-free protein interaction networks (PINs) that facilitate information flow in the cell. Because of their plasticity, IDPs typically occupy hub positions in cellular PINs. Furthermore, their conformational dynamics and propensity for post-translational modifications contribute to ""conformational"" noise which is distinct from the well-recognized transcriptional noise. Therefore, upregulation of IDPs in response to a specific input, such as stress, contributes to increased noise and, hence, an increase in stochastic, ""promiscuous"" interactions. These interactions lead to activation of latent pathways or can induce ""rewiring"" of the PIN to yield an optimal output underscoring the critical role of IDPs in regulating information flow. We have used PAGE4, a highly intrinsically disordered stress-response protein as a paradigm. Employing a variety of experimental and computational techniques, we have elucidated the role of PAGE4 in phenotypic switching of prostate cancer cells at a systems level. These cumulative studies over the past decade provide a conceptual framework to better understand how IDP conformational dynamics and conformational noise might facilitate cellular decision-making.",2021,Biophys Rev,"Kulkarni, Prakash; Achuthan, Srisairam; Bhattacharya, Supriyo; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Kotnala, Sourabh; Leite, Vitor B P; Mohanty, Atish; Orban, John; Roy, Susmita; Rangarajan, Govindan; Salgia, Ravi"

"Insights Gained in the Aftermath of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Follow-Up Survey of a Recreational Training Program, Focusing on Sense of Coherence and Sleep Quality","The original aim of this study was a follow-up assessment of a recreational program running for six months (September 2019-February 2020) within controlled conditions. Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey acquired a new goal: how do the subjects of the follow-up sampling experience this severe stress situation, and in this experience, what role does physical activity and a salutogenetic sense of coherence play. Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality. Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved (Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change. The women in possession of a relatively stronger SOC continued the training (OR = 3.6, CI 95% = 1.2-12.2), and their sleep quality deteriorated to a lesser degree. (OR = 1.7, CI 95% = 1.1-2.8). Conclusion: The data reinforce the interdependency between physical exercise (PE) and SOC; furthermore, the personal training that the authors formulated for middle-aged women proved to be successful in strengthening their sense of coherence, and it also reduced the deterioration in sleep quality due to stress.",2020,Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),"Szovák, Etelka; Varga, Károly; Pelyva, Imre Zoltán; Soós, Rita; Jeges, Sára; Kívés, Zsuzsanna; Tóth, Ákos Levente"
A Longitudinal Study of Subjective Daytime Sleepiness Changes in Elementary School Children Following a Temporary School Closure Due to COVID-19,"Excessive daytime sleepiness is increasingly being recognized as a major global health concern. However, there have been few studies related to sleepiness and its associated factors in elementary school children. In Japan, all schools were closed from February to May 2020 to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the subjective sleepiness of pupils during the 1.5-year period and to elucidate factors associated with changes in sleepiness. Questionnaire surveys about pupils' sleep habits and the Japanese version of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS-J) were conducted longitudinally at one elementary school in June 2019, January 2020, and June 2020. The average &#8710;PDSS score was 0.94 ± 5.51 (mean ± standard deviation) from June 2019 to January 2020 and -1.65 ± 5.71 (t[498] = 6.13, p < 0.01) from January 2020 to June 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that decreasing social jetlag was associated with decreasing PDSS scores (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96, p = 0.02) during the school closure. A less restrictive school schedule secondary to a COVID-19-related school closure decreased sleepiness in children and was associated with decreasing social jetlag.",2021,,"Komada, Yoko; Ishibashi, Yoshiki; Hagiwara, Shunta; Kobori, Mariko; Shimura, Akiyoshi"

End-of-use and end-of-life medicines-insights from pharmaceutical care process into waste medicines management,"End-of-use and end-of-life medicines waste management has been a challenge for public and private managers in different countries. Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the process-from administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicine's lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers. These results clarify the literature on end-of-use and end-of-life medicines reverse logistics. It also provides managers of 5000 municipalities in the country a perspective on the most relevant critical factors involved in their decision-making process, concerning the reuse of end-of-use medicines or the adequate disposal of end-of-life medicines in the environment.",2021,Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Radiofrequency Ablation on Autonomously Functioning Thyroid Nodules: A Critical Appraisal and Review of the Literature.,"Background: Thyroid nodules are an extremely common occurrence, as their prevalence in the general population is estimated to range between 50 and 70%. Some of these nodules are autonomously functioning such that they can cause hyperthyroidism over time. In this case, surgery and radioiodine represent the standard of care. Nevertheless, patients might have contraindications or be unwilling to undergo these treatments. Minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided techniques, such as laser and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been recently introduced into clinical practice as an alternative treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Due to their efficacy and tolerability, these techniques have become increasingly available and their usage has been extended also to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Methods: In this narrative review, we will describe the studies reporting the therapeutic effects of RFA on AFTN, the studies reporting how RFA compares to the other treatment modalities, as well as the current indications for the use of RFA in patients with AFTN. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by three investigators on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception up to February 2020 to identify published articles concerning the effects of RFA on AFTN. Results and Conclusions: Current consensus statements and guidelines support the notion that RFA should be regarded as a first-line therapy for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules, while it remains a valid second-line option for AFTN treatment in case of contraindications or patient unwillingness to undergo surgery or radioiodine.",2020,Frontiers in endocrinology,"Cesareo, Roberto; Palermo, Andrea; Pasqualini, Valerio; Manfrini, Silvia; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Stacul, Fulvio; Fabris, Bruno; Bernardi, Stella"

CXCL10 and trafficking of virus-specific T cells during coronavirus-induced demyelination.,"Chronic expression of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) is associated with an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 neutralizing antibody results in limited CD4+ T cell infiltration into the CNS accompanied by a reduction in white matter damage. The current study determines the antigen-specificity of the T lymphocytes present during chronic disease and evaluates how blocking CXCL10 signaling affects retention of virus-specific T cells within the CNS. CXCL10 neutralization selectively reduced accumulation and/or retention of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, yet exhibited limited effect on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. The response of CXCL10 neutralization on virus-specific T cell subsets is not due to differential expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 on T cells as there was no appreciable difference in receptor expression on virus-specific T cells during either acute or chronic disease. These findings emphasize the importance of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in amplifying demyelination in JHMV-infected mice. In addition, differential signals are required for trafficking and retention of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during chronic demyelination in JHMV-infected mice.",2009,Autoimmunity,"Stiles, Linda N; Liu, Michael T; Kane, Joy A C; Lane, Thomas E"

Effects of Micronutrients or Conditional Amino Acids on COVID-19-Related Outcomes: An Evidence Analysis Center Scoping Review,"Recent narrative reviews have described the potential efficacy of providing individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with additional micronutrients to reduce disease severity. Although there are compelling reasons why providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids may affect COVID-19-related outcomes, evidence is lacking. The objective of this scoping review is to explore and describe the literature examining the effect of providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids (glutamine, arginine) in adults with conditions or infections similar to COVID-19 infection on COVID-19-related health outcomes. A literature search of the MEDLINE database and hand search of Cochrane Database of systematic reviews retrieved 1,423 unique studies, and 8 studies were included in this scoping review. Four studies examined a target population with ventilator-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the other 4 studies included patients who were at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Interventions included intravenous ascorbic acid, intramuscular cholecalciferol, enteral and intramuscular vitamin E, enteral zinc sulfate, and oral and parenteral glutamine. In 6 of the 8 included studies, baseline status of the nutrient of interest was not reported and, thus, it is uncertain how outcomes may vary in the context of nutrient deficiency or insufficiency compared with sufficiency. In the absence of direct evidence examining efficacy of providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids to standard care, registered dietitian nutritionists must rely on clinical expertise and indirect evidence to guide medical nutrition therapy for patients infected with COVID-19.",2020,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,"Rozga, Mary; Cheng, Feon W; Moloney, Lisa; Handu, Deepa"

If nothing else, like all life forms on Earth, humans require water—water that is both reliably available and free of contaminants and pathogens. Meeting these goals is, perhaps, one of the greatest challenges of human kind. In this chapter, we introduce and analyze case studies to expose the evolving nature of our relationship with water.",2020-08-28,Ecology and Management of Inland Waters,"Los Huertos, Marc"
Ozone therapy for patients with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia: a single-center prospective cohort study,"Importance Aside from supportive management, there remains no specific treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: Determine whether ozonated autohemotherapy is associated with a shorter time to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: Single-center proof-of-concept prospective cohort study. Setting: Internal Medicine ward at Policlinica Ibiza Hospital, Spain. Participants: Eighteen consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection and severe pneumonia who were admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. Exposures: Patients in the ozonated autohemotherapy arm received hemotherapy twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of 4 days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g/mL ozone concentration. Patients in the control arm received supportive care. Assignment to hemotherapy versus usual care was determined based on the admitting physician on the day of admission, with only one of the three possible physicians prescribing ozonated autohemotherapy Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement, which was defined as either hospital discharge or a two-point improvement in clinical status measured on a six-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were clinical improvement measured on the 7th, 14th and 28th day after admission, as well as time to a 2-fold reduction in concentrations of C-protein reactive, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 68 y and 72% (n=13) were male. Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. In unadjusted comparisons, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with significantly shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p=0.04) and significantly higher proportion of patients achieving 14-day clinical improvement (88.8% vs 33.3%, p=0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p=0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42). Conclusions and Relevance: Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement in this prospective cohort study. Given the small sample size and single-center study design, these observations require evaluation in larger randomized controlled trials.",2020-06-05,,"HERNANDEZ, A.; VINALS, M.; PABLOS, A.; VILAS, F.; PAPADAKOS, P.
